# 11.11 Structure & registrations

## Description

Proof of the business‚Äô existence, trading structure, and name ‚Äì where it all begins!

## Examples

Business entity registrations; trading name registrations; income and sales tax registrations; trademark records for trading names; company director identity applications.

## Overview

This ID is about your business being born. Think of it like your birth certificate and proof of name. Deciding on a trading structure and name are the first steps to starting a business. This affects how you will operate and the various obligations you will have, especially government taxes.

Whether you want to trade alone under your own name, or as a company with staff and its own name, you will have to complete certain registrations to ‚Äòexist‚Äô. The more complicated the structure, the more paperwork there will be. But for many people with simple structures, once you‚Äôre set up, this ID should be pretty quiet (apart from ensuring registrations stay active).

## Exceptions

Put product or brand-related patents, trademarks, and copyrights in [[20-29]].

# Why is my product IP not here?

This ID is _not_ related to your product or service. You might conduct different types of business under one entity. Hence, we recommend that any trademark records for the business name should go here. But if you have other patents, trademarks, or copyrights, they should live with the things they protect.

# 11.12 Licences, permits, & accreditations

## Description

Documents that you apply for, or are earned via training, so you can legally provide a service or operate in a particular location.

## Examples

Liquor licence; safe food handling certificate; truck or taxi licence; police check; zoning permit; government security clearance; market stall holder permit; working with children check; tradesperson licence; responsible service of alcohol certificate; environmental permit; any other legally-required core qualification.

## Overview

This ID is for storing copies of any licence, permit, or accreditation that your business cannot trade without. First, you registered your business. Now you need the legal proof that you can provide a product or service.

This ‚Äòproof‚Äô will vary considerably depending on what you do. If you run a bar, you‚Äôll need a liquor licence. If you‚Äôre a healthcare provider in private practice, you must have a degree, as well as any other required accreditations.

This is an important ID to keep up-to-date in your JDex and to set reminders for so nothing expires.

## Exceptions

## Also see

Manage ongoing training or education in [[11.50]], but store a copy of the proof of completion here if it‚Äôs essential to your ability to trade.

# Keeping copies of ‚Äòstatic‚Äô documents

You might be thinking, ‚Äúhey Johnny Decimal, you‚Äôve always said not to have copies of things in different places‚Äù. Absolutely ‚Äì for documents that _change_, like a budget spreadsheet. You should never have multiple copies of things like that because someone will inevitably update the wrong version.

However, licences, permits, and accreditations are static documents. Probably a PDF or a piece of paper. It‚Äôs okay to put copies of them where it‚Äôs helpful and makes sense to do so. They‚Äôre not going to change unless they are renewed.

# Why did we create this ID?

If an inspector turns up at your door, having copies of these core documents in one place will be very handy. They‚Äôre also highly visible at the top of your system so they‚Äôre not lost or forgotten.
