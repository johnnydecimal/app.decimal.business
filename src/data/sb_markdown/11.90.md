# 11.90 The business & its people library

## Description

A place to put information that’s related to this category, kinda interesting, mostly unimportant, and definitely doesn’t fit elsewhere.

## Ops manual

## Examples

## More info

Caution. This is a place for when there is no other place. Don’t get lazy and dump stuff here that is important and/or has a home elsewhere in the system.

This might be information that you found interesting or might be useful someday. But right now, it’s not strongly related to any other ID. And it would not make sense to clutter an existing ID or create a new one for it.

It’s a library so we want to keep it neat. Label any files with clear descriptions and use the year-month method in case the information is time sensitive.

### Why are there no IDs here?

It’s difficult to imagine how these libraries might be used. So we didn’t want to commit to IDs just yet. By leaving these sections blank, we thought it might be a good way to introduce everyone to the careful consideration that goes into making a new ID.

If you’re ready to save things in this library, come over to the [[community]] and see what others are doing or ask us for advice. We’ll figure it out together and eventually settle on some standard IDs. In the meantime, just keep things neat and tidy here.

### Leave yourself JDex notes

Remember to leave a note in your JDex when you save things in this library so you can find them easily.

(This is a good habit to get into, by the way. Don’t agonise if you’re unsure where something should go. Find the first relevant ID, make a decision, and leave yourself a note. Having a well-maintained JDex means you’ll never lose anything again.)

## Exceptions

Things that contain information that is specific to your business, and that don’t fit elsewhere, should go in [[13.14]].

## Rationale

We wanted to be realistic and acknowledge that sometimes there is miscellanea that accumulates over time.

It could be anything – a document, photo, URL, email, note, or a physical item. But it’s not the _work_ that you do. It’s things that you’ve found online or in real life, or perhaps that you’ve created.

It doesn’t fit anywhere else. It’s just a thing you wanted to save. And you don’t want it muddying other folders where work happens.

Importantly, it’s not that important. It has nothing to do with business operations. If it wasn’t backed up it wouldn’t matter. If you lose it, you could probably download it again.
