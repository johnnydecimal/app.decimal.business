# 12.21 Keep the basics running

## Description

Basic utility connections and services.

## Ops manual

## Examples

Utility connections and bills (electricity, gas, water, telephone, internet); troubleshooting instructions; staff mobile phone contracts; parking bills; HVAC services.

## Overview

This is the foundation of your back office. Keeping the lights on and the phones ringing.

All the account paperwork and bills go here, neatly sorted by year-month. And if you have more than one back office, use per-site subfolders and keep things consistent.

These utilities and services might be specific to the back office, or they might also support the front office. It doesn’t matter if there’s some overlap, as long as you know where things are.

A cafe might have one electricity connection that supplies all areas. Or a co-working space might have one wifi connection for back office staff and front office tenants.

In both cases, they prefer to store their bills and other paperwork in back office. (Hint: just write yourself a note in your JDex if this applies to you.)

This would also be a good place to put troubleshooting tips related to a service.

For instance, under ‘water’ save instructions for how to turn the water main off. Under ‘electricity’ save a diagram of the fuse box layout and what to do in a blackout or power surge. Under ‘internet’ save instructions for how to reset the wifi router.
