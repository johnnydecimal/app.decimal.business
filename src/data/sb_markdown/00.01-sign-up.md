## Description

Sign up to the small business system here.

## Lifetime

Lifetime membership is a one-time payment. There's nothing else to pay, ever again. It's [US$300](https://store.johnnydecimal.com/cart/43063017111688:1).

For this you get:

#### The Small Business System

- And all of its updates, future improvements, and content updates, _forever_.
- Lucy and I plan on working on this full-time for the next few years. It'll be like having us on your staff.

#### All of our existing products

- The [Johnny.Decimal Workshop](https://jdcm.al/14.22).
- The [Johnny.Decimal Workbook](https://jdcm.al/14.21).
- The [Life Admin System](https://jdcm.al/14.11).
- [Learn with Lucy](https://jdcm.al/32.02), our 14-hour beginner Excel course.

You can access these immediately.

#### Everything else we ever do, for life

- Seriously: everything we ever create, forever.
- For example, I'm planning open video sessions where we can solve your business problems together.
- â€¦and whatever else you ask for: we'll listen to the community and give you what you need.

[Sign up today for US$300](https://store.johnnydecimal.com/cart/43063017111688:1). Then nothing else, ever again.

## Annual

Annual membership is [US$150/year](https://store.johnnydecimal.com/cart/43069054648456:1).

You get the 'existing products' listed above _except_ the Learn with Lucy Excel course.

If you choose not to renew your membership, you'll never lose access to your existing system. Your files are always under your control. But you'll lose access to this site, and all of its content, future updates, and any community features like video calls.

Your membership will renew one year after the full system is released, not one year after your initial payment.

## Pre-launch

These are pre-launch offer prices. They will increase over time as the system is developed: specifically, Lifetime will become more than 2x Annual. Get in now!

We are working on the system 6 days a week. I write this on February 28th 2025 -- launch is _close_.

## Guarantee

I guarantee that this system will save you time, and help your business. Me and Lucy take extraordinary pride in our work. This is our life. And as a small business, we depend entirely on satisfied customers and word-of-mouth.

So if you're not happy, I'm not happy. If you don't think that the price was worth it, let me know and you can have your money back.
