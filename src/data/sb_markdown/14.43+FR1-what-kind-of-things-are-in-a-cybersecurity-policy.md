# What kind of things are in a cybersecurity policy?

A cybersecurity policy might address behaviours around things like:

- passwords, passphrases, and multi-factor authentication,
- threat awareness when using email, websites, and search engines,
- threat awareness when answering phone calls,
- what is ‘acceptable use’ of the business’ network, computers, and devices,
- use of personal devices for business purposes,
- working from home,
- network protection,
- keeping operating systems and antivirus software up to date,
- responsible data handling,
- use of storage devices,
- and how to report a threat or get help if a security event occurs.
