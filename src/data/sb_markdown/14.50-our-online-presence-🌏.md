# 14.50 Our online presence

## Description

The administration of sites and accounts where your business is represented online.

## Examples

## Overview

Think about this section as being similar to your office deeds, vehicle registrations, or the paperwork you did to set up the business entity. It’s about the underlying _administration_ of your online presence.

It’s _not_ the words, images, or videos that you publish. Anything that you add to a website, blog, or social media account is a creative job. Any email newsletter you send is a creative job. And that is managed in your creative inputs and outputs categories.

## Exceptions

This is not where you produce and store the content that you publish online, that happens in [[80-89]] and [[90-99]].

This is not where you manage anything to do with a marketing campaign or other self-promotion, that happens in [[XX-XX]].
