# 12.50 The community

## Description

You’re part of something bigger – interactions with the neighbourhood, the region, the planet.

## Examples

## Overview

Your business is part of a wider community – schools, hospitals, clubs, local government and media, the environment, etc. And sometimes it will interact with the community in different ways.

This section isn’t about your core business, your employees, suppliers, or professional bodies. It’s a place for civics, community engagement, and being a good business citizen. It’s giving versus getting.

This is a broad umbrella and may not be that relevant for many businesses. But if this sounds like you, then put any relevant contact details, notes, and other documents here.
