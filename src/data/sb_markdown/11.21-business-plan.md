This may be less relevant if you’re, say, a freelance graphic designer working on a project-by-project basis. But for most other businesses, whether new or existing, this is something you shouldn’t skip.

A business plan contains all the good stuff like your mission and vision statements, goals, risk analysis, and financial position. Do periodic reviews and remember to save the previous version of the document when updating it. And if you have innovative services or practices, you may wish to protect the plan with a confidentiality agreement. 

If you’ve never written one, government business websites often have handy templates to get you started.
