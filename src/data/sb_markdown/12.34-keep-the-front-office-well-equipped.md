# 12.34 Keep the front office well equipped

## Description

Supplies and equipment that help us deliver our product or service.

## Examples

Free-standing furniture that isn’t part of a fit-out; branded items like napkins and paper shopping bags; electrical appliances; payment equipment like tills and handheld ‘tap and go’ units; general office supplies and stationery; ongoing service contracts for specialised equipment.

## Overview

This is for any kind of equipment and supplies that you use to run the front office and deliver your product or service to customers. What’s in this ID is going to vary widely for different businesses.

## Exceptions

Furniture that is a permanent fixture built during a fit-out goes in [[12.14]].

If a third party controls and services any IT equipment, manage that here. If you control it, it goes in [[14.10]].

Any item that you sell goes in [[20-29]]. So if you’re a retail shop, that’s your product inventory and that does not go here (your branded shopping bags do though).
