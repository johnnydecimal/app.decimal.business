# An example: How Johnny managed Microsoft logins

Johnny once had a developer subscription that enabled him to access many Microsoft accounts. He made a JDex note about how the accounts were set up and inter-related.

It was complex. You couldn’t log in to this thing before logging in to that thing. He even set up different browser profiles and explained in the note what each was for. Because sometimes he needed to be logged in as an admin, and sometimes as a user.

He kept links to all the login pages, plus clear instructions on what to do. This was a direct replacement for browser bookmarks, where it’s easy for this sort of thing to get lost.

Hopefully your work life isn’t this complex. But this is one of the many things you could use this ID for to create a little bit of serenity.
