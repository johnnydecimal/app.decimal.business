# 12.24 Keep the back office well equipped

## Description

Office equipment and stationery.

## Ops manual

## Examples

Buying standard office furniture like desks, chairs, cupboards and drawers; ordering anything you’d consider stationery from pens and sticky notes to paper and toner; ongoing lease and maintenance contracts for specialised equipment (maybe you lease a photocopier).

## More info

This is for any kind of equipment and supplies that you use to run the back office. 

Most likely, this will be classic ‘office stuff’. However, if ‘back office’ means something very specific to your business, then include whatever is relevant for you.

## Exceptions

Furniture that is a permanent fixture built during a fit-out goes in [[12.14]].

If you lease any IT equipment like computers, printers, or photocopiers, put it here. If you buy it, put it in [[14.10]].

## Rationale

We made a decision to separate lease-as-service IT equipment versus one-off purchases. A supplier is providing an ongoing service to you, so managing that becomes part of daily operations. 

But if you buy computers, printers, or other IT gadgets outright, store the records and product manuals with your other technology in [[14.10]].
