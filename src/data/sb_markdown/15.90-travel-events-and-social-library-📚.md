# 15.90 â–  Travel, events, & social library ðŸ“š

## Description

A place to put information thatâ€™s related to this category, kinda interesting, mostly unimportant, and definitely doesnâ€™t fit elsewhere.

## Examples

## Overview

Caution. This is a place for when there is no other place. Donâ€™t get lazy and dump stuff here that is important and/or has a home elsewhere in the system.

This might be information that you found interesting or might be useful someday. But right now, itâ€™s not strongly related to any other ID. And it would not make sense to clutter an existing ID or create a new one for it.

Itâ€™s a library so we want to keep it neat. Label any files with clear descriptions and use the year-month method in case the information is time sensitive.

# Rationale

We wanted to be realistic and acknowledge that sometimes there is miscellanea that accumulates over time. It could be anything â€“ a document, photo, URL, email, note, or a physical item. But itâ€™s not the _work_ that you do. Itâ€™s things that youâ€™ve found online or in real life, or perhaps that youâ€™ve created.

It doesnâ€™t fit anywhere else. Itâ€™s just a thing you wanted to save. And you donâ€™t want it muddying other folders where work happens. Importantly, itâ€™s not that important. It has nothing to do with business operations. If it wasnâ€™t backed up it wouldnâ€™t matter. If you lose it, you could probably download it again.

NOTES:
Remember to add an insurance ID in the same pattern as other categories
e.g. product liability insurance, what else?
Also referred to as â€˜goods and servicesâ€™ in accounting, should we do the same?

Customer management: remember to have a knowledge base, and how do we capture feedback and complaints etc - a third-party zen desk thing? Phone calls? Verbal at your shop? (this came from a note in 14 technology min map: External support request management, e.g. what happens when a customer writes about an issue? We have a customer service policy higher up, but the details are in customer management, we think)
