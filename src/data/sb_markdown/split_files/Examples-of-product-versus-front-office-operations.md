# Examples of product versus front office operations

A baker’s pie is their product. The branded napkins for customers are a front office supply (and they’re not what staff get in the back office).

A haircut is a hairdresser’s product. The coffee and biscuits for customers are front office supplies.

A clean dog is a dog groomer’s product. The hose used to wash it is a front office supply.
