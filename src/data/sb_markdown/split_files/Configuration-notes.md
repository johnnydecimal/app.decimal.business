# Configuration notes

We decided that notes related to the configuration of any storage device or service in this category would live with the thing itself. For instance, when you get a fancy new hard drive there’s usually an interface with settings to select. The same goes for the various cloud storage services. There’s always settings and preferences to configure. Record what you did here.
