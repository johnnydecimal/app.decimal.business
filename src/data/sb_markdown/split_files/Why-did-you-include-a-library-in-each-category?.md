# Why did you include a library in each category?

We wanted to be realistic and acknowledge that sometimes there is miscellanea that accumulates over time. It could be anything – a document, photo, URL, email, note, or a physical item. But it’s not the _work_ that you do. It’s things that you’ve found online or in real life, or perhaps that you’ve created.

It doesn’t fit anywhere else. It’s just a thing you wanted to save. And you don’t want it muddying other folders where work happens. Importantly, it’s not that important. It has nothing to do with business operations. If it wasn’t backed up it wouldn’t matter. If you lose it, you could probably download it again.
