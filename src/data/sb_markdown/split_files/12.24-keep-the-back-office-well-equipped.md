# 12.24 Keep the back office well equipped

## Description

Office equipment and stationery.

## Examples

Buying standard office furniture like desks, chairs, cupboards and drawers; ordering anything you’d consider stationery from pens and sticky notes to paper and toner; ongoing service contracts for specialised equipment (like a fancy photocopier).

## Overview

This is for any kind of equipment and supplies that you use to run the back office. Most likely, this will be classic ‘office stuff’. However, if ‘back office’ means something very specific to your business, then include whatever is relevant for you.

## Exceptions

Furniture that is a permanent fixture built during a fit-out goes in [[12.14]].

If a third party controls and services any IT equipment, manage that here. If you control it, it goes in [[14.10]].
