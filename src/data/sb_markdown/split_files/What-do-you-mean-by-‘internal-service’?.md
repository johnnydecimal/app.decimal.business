# What do you mean by ‘internal service’?

_Anything you can do on a computer because there’s a combination of devices, software, and/or third-party services working together._

The base set of internal services that a business might supply to staff includes:

- user login,
- internet connectivity,
- wifi connectivity,
- printing,
- file services.

This ID is a place to describe how the internal service was set up, for the administrator. And instructions for how to connect to the internal service, for users. Which might just be you wearing two different hats.

## Exceptions

This is not for software that you’ve developed for sale – that goes in [[20-29]].
