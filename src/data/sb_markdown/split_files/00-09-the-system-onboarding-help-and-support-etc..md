# 00-09 The system, onboarding, help & support, etc.

To dos & discussions:

Tick boxes to say you've read and understand a thing.

A disclaimer.

I understand that this is system of organisation and Johnny and Lucy are not business advisers or financial experts. They are not liable for anything that happens to my business. The management of the files I've downloaded from this are my responsibility, etc etc. Includes a link to the overall Shopify-stle disclaimer wording that lives somewhere in the system.

The handling of bills, purchases, and receipts.

13 is where you process bill payments and purchases, for everything. Store a copy of the receipt in the relevant ID elsewhere if you want. Otherwise file it in 13.33 Receipts. And if you do nearly everything in accounting software then as you were, but note that 13 is a place to store stuff that's outside of this software.

Don't clutter every ID talking about this in 'Also see' etc, say it once upfront. "But just so you know upfront, this could apply to any ID that involves money, so make a decision, and leave yourself a JDex note about this decision. Do this for all decisions you made when learning about this system so you remember in future, and staff will know why some things are done a certain way".

The system rationale.

We have rationales for each ID, but we also need some mega rationales about the entire system, why it is the way it is, that are upfront and you tick.

Here is some draft text I began on this earlier:

In [[10-19]], our goal is that these categories could be the foundation of _any_ business, regardless of the product or service you offer. In theory, you should be able to keep the same business structure, but completely change your offering and still use this area. Whereas, [[20-29]] is specific to how you create and market what you sell.

For example, you are a gardener and your registered business structure is 'sole trader'. After 5 years you decide to trade as a freelance hairdresser, another skill you have. You don't want or need to change your structure. Sole trader is fine. And all the other IDs in this area are still relevant, you'll just be saving some revised information in them. The government doesn't care, as long as you keep sending them those tax dollars.

For example, over the years our company, Coruscade, has been used to run a dance production, manage an IT contractor business, and now Johnny.Decimal. Coruscade could have used [[10-19]] to administer any of these businesses. But the dance production and Johnny.Decimal need their own product and marketing areas.

For example, a shell company might have several products and/or operate several business at once. But it just has one batch of government tax reporting. The ‘timber’ business in New Zealand has a similar situation – one entity, several businesses. [[10-19]] is designed to accommodate this scenario.

Other notes I’d made:

- You don’t have to fill the system, most of us won’t use many sections. No front office or business vehicle? That’s ok, many will just have the money and important docs stuff.
- Cover off definition of business/size - includes not-for-profit, clubs, charities, volunteering.

How to handle meetings & communications

An explanation and process/ops manual/how-to/rationale.

Johnny has started to write this and draw diagrams.

Overarching JD concepts

An explanation of key JD concepts and links to the website for further reading.

Because we will just be talking about these things in the text. And if you’re new to Johnny.Decimal, you will be like, huh? For example, the index/JDex - what it is, why it’s great, and that you must actively use it/leave yourself notes. We can’t assume people will have a notes app and understand what an index is without telling them.

Wikilinks.

In 14.14 I left a note to reiterate this text in the help section.
