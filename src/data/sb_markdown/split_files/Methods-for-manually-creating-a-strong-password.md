NOTES:
Ops manual:
Somebody has asked for access to a system - should they have it? If so, how to do it, where do you record that they have access? Onboarding and offboarding: setting up new accounts and disabling access, disabling email account on Google Workspace console, how do you ensure that someone who left has their access taken away? And their devices returned? And their licences re-pooled? And their software deactivated?
See 14.41 text file for words we deleted for future consideration about locations of tools and things used everyday and bookmarks - it might be system-wide versus just applicable here.
