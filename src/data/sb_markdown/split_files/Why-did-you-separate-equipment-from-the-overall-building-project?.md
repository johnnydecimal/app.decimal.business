# Why did you separate equipment from the overall building project?

Similar to [[12.14]], we made a decision that these type of projects are about building and installing things that are designed for a specific vehicle – and they’re unlikely to have an ops manual. For instance, a built-in bench in a food truck.

Whereas front or back office _equipment_ ordered as part of a project might have service contracts, or staff training and cleaning manuals, so that belongs in operations. For instance, a coffee cart’s espresso machine or till.
