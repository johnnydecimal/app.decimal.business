# 12.0X Supplier library

## Description

A library of real-world or online suppliers of goods and services that you use for your back and/or front office and vehicles.

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place to store contact details, agreements, contracts, and other over-arching records, all neatly templated.

## Exceptions

This is not for specialised suppliers that directly relate to the product or service that you sell, put those in [[20-29]]. For example, if youâ€™re a baker, the flour and seeds to make bread sit with the product. But the napkins provided for customers are part of front office operations.
