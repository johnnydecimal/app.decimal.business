# 12.14 Fit-outs, renovations, & improvements

## Description

A place for larger projects that aren’t general upkeep.

## Examples

Fitting-out a hair salon with walls, flooring, cabinetry, sinks, and a kitchen area; renovating a warehouse’s plumbing, ventilation, and concrete floor, and upgrading the internet connection; installing custom-made, fixed benches and planter boxes at the front of a bar; improvements to a workshop in a home garage that include building a new workbench and fixed shelving; mood boards, measurements, and a budget spreadsheet for repainting a cafe.

## Overview

This is a place to manage larger structural projects that have an end. And once done, you move into back or front office operations mode. As such, we recommend that any equipment ordered as part of the project be stored in those sections.

This ID might be empty for many businesses. Like us. Our office is a room in a rented house. We will never be renovating it. However, it will be very busy for others. The hair salon above is based on a friend who spent a hectic 6 months fitting out a new space.
