## Overview

This is a place to store any curated lists of where you go online for business-related information. These lists have probably been developed over time, are specific to your work, and you don’t want to lose them.

Maybe you want to store a copy outside of your browser bookmarks for reasons. Perhaps you want to share them with others. For example, when onboarding new staff you might provide a list of helpful resources like:

- industry newsletters to sign up for,
- trusted websites for research and reading,
- blogs and RSS feeds to follow,
- communities to join,
- YouTube or social media accounts to follow.
- or trade journals to review.

Note that this is a ‘special-case’ ID that happens to be in the technology library. Organise the rest of this library as you wish.
