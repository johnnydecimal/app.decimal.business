# Putting our IT pants on

Before we go deeper into this category, let’s take a small breath.

We’re conscious that not everyone is a tech-head and we don’t want to scare you with too many IT concepts or words. But we also know that you’re a smart human – you run a business! You can handle some tech talk.

One of the aims of this category is to help demystify some computer stuff. As business owners we do need to be on top of it. There’s too much at stake. Turns out it’s not actually that mysterious once you know the basics.

So if you’ve looked ahead and are thinking “what on Earth are internal and external software and services?”, bear with us. These words bubbled up naturally when we were figuring this section out. And they’re the kind of words that an IT professional might use.

If we can start thinking more like them, even just a little bit, we’ll better understand our own setups, how to troubleshoot problems, when to ask for help, and the right questions to ask to get things fixed quickly.
