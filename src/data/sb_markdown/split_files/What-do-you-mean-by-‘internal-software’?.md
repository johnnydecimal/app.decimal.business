# What do you mean by ‘internal software’?

_Any software (fancy or low-code no-code), scripts, or automations you’ve created to help the business._

This might include things like:

- a personalised dashboard or widget,
- a script or complex formula in a spreadsheet,
- an automation in Airtable,
- a Zapier workflow,
- Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) customisations for Microsoft Office,
- or any type of in-house software you’ve developed.
