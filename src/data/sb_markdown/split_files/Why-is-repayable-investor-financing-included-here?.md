# Why is repayable investor financing included here?

We made a decision to include any sort of repayable investor financing here as a cash loan account. Depending on who it’s from, it might not be set up like a typical bank loan account. But you’ll still have some form of repayment obligations and/or ‘statements’ to track, process, and file.
