# Why did you separate ownership records from earnings?

We decided to separate the ownership records for assets/investments and their earnings for clarity and neatness. In this ID we’re only interested in filing the processed income earned.

For example:

```
ASSET/INVESTMENT      PASSIVE INCOME
(stored in 13.40)     (stored here)
═════════════════════════════════════
Cash term deposit     Interest
Shares                Dividend
Property              Rent
```
