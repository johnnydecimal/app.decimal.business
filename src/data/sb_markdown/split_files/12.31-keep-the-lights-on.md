# 12.31 Keep the lights on

## Description

Additional utility connections and services.

## Examples

Utility connections and bills (electricity, gas, water, telephone, internet); any other fees related to heating or cooling (like a generator or ice); troubleshooting instructions.

## Overview

This is a place for any basic utilities and services that are _only_ in the front office. This might be empty if your back office utilities cover both areas. But if not, keep the account paperwork and bills here, neatly sorted by year-month.

And if you have more than one front office (maybe you have a couple of retail outlets), use per-site subfolders and keep things consistent.

This would also be a good place to put troubleshooting tips related to a service. For instance, under ‘internet’ save instructions for how to reset the wifi router. Under ‘gas’ save the preferred locations to swap gas bottles.

## Exceptions

## Also see

Mobile phone contracts and bills go here, but the management of the device itself lives in [[14.12]].
