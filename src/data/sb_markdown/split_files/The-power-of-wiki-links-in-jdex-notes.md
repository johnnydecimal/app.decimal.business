# The power of wiki links in JDex notes

If you are torn about where any accessories should live, don’t stress. Remember that we can create wiki links in our JDex notes to other IDs. If we do this, we’re not going to lose anything.

In the example above, we store our card reader in [[12.34]]. In that JDex note, we add a bullet point that says “The iPad that controls this card reader is at [[14.12]]”.

This advice goes for anything else in your system where there’s a little ambiguity. Links are our friends.

OPS MANUALS

Notes I’d made:

- Which ones will we do for v1?
  - All inboxes, 13.21, 13.31, 13.41, 13.51, 13.61
  - 14.23 Backups & recovery:
    - encryption of customer data
    - how to restore a file from last week in whatever you use
    - Time Machine, Backblaze, call your IT person
- We provide some versus you write some (DIY, so much we can’t know).
- We need a consistent way to tell people how to write their own.
- e.g. 11.23, we’ve suggested a DIY ops manual.

  - It might be a list of things to grab in an emergency in your JDex.
  - Plus other stuff to do, link relevant IDs in this system.
  - Do we need a standard zero for ‘locations’.
  - i.e. All the places you keep important stuff, then can wiki link them.

- Johnny to create a system-wide ops manual for that explains with examples what a static document is versus a changeable document. So you'll just be able to link to an ID vs. having this custom footnote.

See 13 Section header footnote:

\*By ‘static’ we mean things that were sent to you that can’t be changed (e.g. a PDF). As compared to internal files that you work on (e.g. a spreadsheet). You should never have multiple copies of the latter. You’ll end up working on the wrong version and being very sad when you realise. This is not the Decimal way.

- Which ones will we do in future?
  - See notes in most back/front office operations IDs

TEMPLATES AND PATTERNS

Templates we said we’d make, and naming/filing patterns we should recommend.

Folder templates we said we’d make:

- 11.42 Staff record keeping
- 14.20 Storage, data, & backups
- 14.32 External software & services
- 12.0X Supplier library (see notes under this ID)

Other templates we could make someday:

- Related to: 14.32 External software & services
  - A Baserow of all the great software
- Noted in 12.21: create processes and/or template
  - Choose a pattern for the per-site subfolders and for saving/re-naming bills
  - Plus all supplier bills, consistently, using the date to sort

Naming/filing patterns we should recommend:

- Year-month-day
- When to use the alphabet
- What else?

PASSWORDS & SECURITY RELATED

In 14.43 Behavioural cybersecurity, we say not to write down passwords.

Then a comment says:
Other than printing out your recovery kit and storing it in a vault. Complicated to explain … might need to figure out where that goes. Here might not be the best place.

Do we need a help/how-to about recovery?
