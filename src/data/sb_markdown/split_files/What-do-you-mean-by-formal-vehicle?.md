# What do you mean by formal vehicle?

When we say ‘formal vehicle’, ‘motor vehicle’, or ‘registered vehicle’, it doesn’t matter if it’s a car, trailer, boat, seaplane, caravan, hot-air balloon, or Hansom cab. If it’s core to your business and requires some kind of official paperwork, put it up here.
