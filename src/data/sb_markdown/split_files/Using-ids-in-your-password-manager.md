# Using IDs in your password manager

When you’re saving logins related to different parts of this system in your password manager, add the ID! Then you can search the app for the ID and a keyword.

1Password will let you do this with tags, others might as well. But adding it to the title or another field should also work.

For example, searching for:

- ‘12.25’ will show the logins in your back office related to food and beverage.
- ‘12.25 coffee’ will go straight to your coffee subscription login.
- ‘12.42’ will go straight to your vehicle insurance login, etc.
