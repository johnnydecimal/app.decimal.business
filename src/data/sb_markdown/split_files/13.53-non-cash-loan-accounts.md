# 13.53 Non-cash loan accounts

## Description

The place to file processed statements and other formal paperwork for non-cash accounts that you owe money to.

## Examples

Vendor financing/trade credit; hire purchase or rent to buy agreements.

## Overview

You owe someone money for goods that you haven’t paid for yet.

This might be for products or services from a supplier who didn’t require upfront payment. Or perhaps a vehicle that you have a hire purchase agreement for.

After payments are processed, file the records here using the year-month method so everything sorts neatly. And subfolder by account issuer.
