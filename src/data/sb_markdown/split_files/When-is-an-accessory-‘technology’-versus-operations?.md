# When is an accessory ‘technology’ versus operations?

We made a decision that accessories that are common to _most_ businesses should live here in the technology world. But if you have things that are used to deliver your product or service, that not everyone has, or that are controlled by a third party, they should go in operations.

We acknowledge that there’s potential for overlap here. So this is our thinking.

A printer should live here in [[14]] if:

- It’s a commodity that can be easily replaced (e.g. at any office supply store).
- It has functionality that can be easily replaced (e.g. at any print/copy store).

A printer should live in operations if:

- Not everyone has it (e.g. it prints till receipts or food service dockets).
- It’s business critical (e.g. it prints special product labels in your warehouse).
- It’s controlled by a third party and/or has specialised software.

We would also classify accessories that process payments as part of front office operations. For instance, tap and go card readers or card terminals. These are not common to all businesses and they’re usually associated with ongoing fees or payment plans.

Note that if you use _your_ tablet as a point-of-sale (POS) system to control a card reader, that tablet still lives in [[14.12]]. It’s still a mobile device, plus you might use it for any number of things, not just payments.
