# 13.33 Receipts

## Description

The place to file processed receipts.

## Examples

## Overview

We’ve classified an ‘expense’ as something that you have already paid for either on the spot (i.e. with a card), or via an automatic payment (i.e. a direct debit).

As per the ops manual, once you’ve processed expenses in [[13.31]], permanently file any receipts here.

We recommend using the year-month method when saving this kind of paperwork so everything sorts neatly. And subfolder by expense category.

## Exceptions

These are not bills that you set aside time to pay manually, manage those in [[13.50]].
