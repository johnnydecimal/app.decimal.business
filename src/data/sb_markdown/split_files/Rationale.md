NOTES:
Remember to add an insurance ID in the same pattern as other categories
e.g. product liability insurance, what else?
Also referred to as ‘goods and services’ in accounting, should we do the same?

Customer management: remember to have a knowledge base, and how do we capture feedback and complaints etc - a third-party zen desk thing? Phone calls? Verbal at your shop? (this came from a note in 14 technology min map: External support request management, e.g. what happens when a customer writes about an issue? We have a customer service policy higher up, but the details are in customer management, we think)
