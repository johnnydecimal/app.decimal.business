# 11.42 Staff record keeping

## Description

The official staff records that a business must keep for a certain period of time, neatly templated.

## Examples

## Overview

In Australia, staff records must be kept for up to 7 years. Your government may have different requirements.

We recommend that each employee has a subfolder labelled with the year-month-day they joined (so it sorts neatly) and their name. Inside that is a standard template. We have provided an example template in the folder system. Adjust this to your needs as required, just remember to be consistent.
