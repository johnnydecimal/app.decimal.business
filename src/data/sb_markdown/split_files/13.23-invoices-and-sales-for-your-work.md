# 13.23 Invoices & sales for your work

## Description

The place to file processed invoices or point-of-sale reports.

## Examples

## Overview

However you actively earn money, store the processed records here.

Whether you send out invoices for your work\*, download reports from a till or online platform, or tally up a cash book, these are your sales. This includes long-term income for things like royalties and book sales. You did the work once and continue to get paid for it.

And if you have to deal with bad debts, we recommend noting those here too. They’re still sales, you just didn’t receive the money.

\*Your accountant might refer to this as ‘accounts receivable’.
