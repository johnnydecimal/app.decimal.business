# 13.11 Financial planning

## Description

Calculations, budgets, goals, and strategies to help you know where you stand.

## Examples

## Overview

Whether you’ve received professional financial advice or you’re figuring things out yourself, this is a place to do the work. This ID will probably end up full of notes, calculations, or spreadsheets. Whatever you do here, we recommend subfolder-ing by tax year to keep it neat and relevant to each accounting period.

## Exceptions

This isn’t for costing out how much you charge for your product or service, that goes in [[20-29]].
