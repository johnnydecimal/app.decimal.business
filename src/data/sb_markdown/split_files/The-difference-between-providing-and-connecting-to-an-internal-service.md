# The difference between providing and connecting to an internal service

We’re going pretty deep here. But if you’re interested, here’s why we’re recommending that some details are saved in this ID versus others.

If a device’s configuration relates to _providing_ an internal service, then your config notes live with that device. For example, you type things in the web interface of an ADSL modem/router to create a wifi network. Then you add some bullets to [[14.13]] in your JDex so you can remember what you did.

But the instructions for _connecting_ to an internal service live alongside the service in this ID. For example, how to connect a laptop, phone, or printer to the wifi. Now we're ‘consuming the configuration’, if you like.

Here’s a scenario for our office wifi:

1. Our ISP has configuration – the notes go in [[14.32]].

2. Our ADSL modem has configuration – the notes go in [[14.13]].

3. Our wifi router has configuration. Ditto.

4. We just built a wifi internal service – the notes live here, including:

- a list of the components involved,
- a diagram of how it’s set up,
- instructions on how to connect to it,
- steps to follow if it’s not working.

Basically, just tell yourself a story on what you did so you’ll remember in the future, and you’ll know what devices to check when the wifi is down.

5. When we get a new iPad, we connect it to the wifi with the instructions in step 4.
