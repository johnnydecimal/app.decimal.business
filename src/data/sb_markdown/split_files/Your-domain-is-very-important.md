# Your domain is very important

Your domain name is very important because you can usually only ‘buy’ them for a year (technically it’s a rental). So people forget to renew them and then whoops, everything’s gone. So put a reminder in your calendar. You can build another website anytime. But if someone else gets your domain name, it’s all over.
