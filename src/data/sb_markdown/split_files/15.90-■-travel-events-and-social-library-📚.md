# 15.90 â–  Travel, events, & social library ðŸ“š

## Description

A place to put information thatâ€™s related to this category, kinda interesting, mostly unimportant, and definitely doesnâ€™t fit elsewhere.

## Ops manual

## Examples

## Overview

Caution. This is a place for when there is no other place. Donâ€™t get lazy and dump stuff here that is important and/or has a home elsewhere in the system.

This might be information that you found interesting or might be useful someday. But right now, itâ€™s not strongly related to any other ID. And it would not make sense to clutter an existing ID or create a new one for it.

Itâ€™s a library so we want to keep it neat. Label any files with clear descriptions and use the year-month method in case the information is time sensitive.
