# Saving files for fixed assets

This ID should contain copies of records saved elsewhere in the system. That’s okay because these are static records. We want a place where you and/or your accountant can go to see the proof of ownership and value of any fixed assets in one place.

For example, an electrician’s business premises, van, and computers are fixed assets:

- She manages the business premises in [[12.10]], the vehicle in [[12.40]], and the computers in [[14.10]].
- She copies the proof of ownership, valuations, and receipts here for her accountant.
- And she also has a master finance record in [[13.11]] that includes a summary of her fixed assets because that’s how she rolls.
