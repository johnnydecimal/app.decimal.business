## Overview

This is a place to list all of the types of logins you have and who has access to what. It can be handy to have a snapshot of everything, similar to the list in [[13.35]]. We also recommend keeping notes on how you deal with this stuff.

If this ID starts to get busy, consider using the extend-the-end method with the ‘+’ to nest sub-IDs under the parent ID.
