# 15.XX Business travel

## Description

A neat template to organise work-related trips.

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place to organise any sort of (probably) longer-distance, business-related travel that isn’t day-to-day operations.

Things like attending meetings, conferences, and expos, or any event where you represent the business.

Or perhaps you need to travel to complete a project. For instance, a photographer who travels overseas to do a photoshoot. Or a tradesperson who travels interstate to complete a construction contract.

Whether it’s short term or longer, at the bare minimum you need to get there.

You might need to catch a plane to attend a meeting in another city, but just for the day. Store the plane tickets and any expenses here. If you end up having to stay overnight, record your accommodation details too. If the next meeting is overseas, you might also need visas, vaccinations, and other documents.

That’s why we created a work trip template, so everything stays neat and tidy:

- 10 Planning
- 20 Travel documents & visas ← specific to the trip
- 30 Transport
- 40 Accommodation
- 50 Itineraries & schedules
- 60 Expenses to claim

## Exceptions

This is not for daily vehicle running expenses or deductions, those go in [[12.43]].
