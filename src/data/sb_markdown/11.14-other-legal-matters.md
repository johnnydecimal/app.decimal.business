# 11.14 Other legal matters

## Description

A place for any other legal matters or ‘serious’ documents related to the business entity that a lawyer may have prepared, were issued by the government, or certified by a public official.

## Examples

Statutory declarations; affidavits; documents related to proof of ownership; non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements; change of company director paperwork; contracts that don’t fit elsewhere; financial disputes that make it to court.

## Overview

It’s hard to predict what other core documents a business may have around the world. Or any legal matters that may need to be dealt with. But if it’s important and doesn’t fit elsewhere, put it here in this legal catch-all. And note its location in your JDex.

## Exceptions

We’re still dealing with the business entity here, not employees, products, or suppliers. Any legal matters or ‘serious’ documents related to those things live with them.
