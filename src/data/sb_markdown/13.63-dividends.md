# 13.63 Dividends

## Description

If you need to deal with dividends, manage the details here.

## Examples

## Overview

We can’t advise you on how to manage dividends.\* It’s beyond our scope. We recommend outsourcing the process to an accountant or bookkeeper who specialises in this type of thing.

But we do think that anything to do with dividends lives over here with all the money and numbers. And it feels logical to put dividends after government taxes since they are paid from post-tax profits.

\*Perhaps one day, after community discussion with experienced business owners and accountants/bookkeepers, we can develop an ops manual that covers dividend basics.
