# Using sub-IDs to create separate JDex notes

If you’d like more room for this information, consider using the sub-ID method to create separate JDex notes.

For example:

- ‘14.31+ Google dashboard’,
- ‘14.31+ Excel script’,
- ‘14.31+ Airtable automation’.

These notes will sort neatly under the parent ID. And they’re instantly findable by typing ‘14.31+’ in the search box of your notes app.

We encourage you to use this method whenever you would like more room in your JDex. This way you won’t over-clutter the note for the parent ID.

This is one of the Decimal superpowers.
