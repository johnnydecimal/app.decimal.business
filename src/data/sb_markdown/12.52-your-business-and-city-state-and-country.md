# 12.52 Your business & city, state, & country

## Description

People that your business interacts with further away.

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place for anything to do with relationships that you maintain that are a bit further away – your town or city, state or province, or country.

Maybe you have interactions with your local chamber of commerce. Or perhaps your business donates its product or services to an annual charity event, parade, or community group. You might host high school work experience students each year. Or your staff might do regular volunteer work or mentoring.

What’s that? There’s chocolate fundraising boxes in the kitchen? Save me a Picnic while I store the documentation here!
