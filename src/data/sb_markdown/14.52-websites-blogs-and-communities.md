# 14.52 Websites, blogs, & communities

## Description

The general admin related to setting up and managing websites, blogs, and communities.

## Examples

Whether you set up your site with a third-party service, hired a web designer, or coded it yourself, you might record things like: how it’s built; where it’s hosted; how to update it; where the logins are in your password manager; where the code is (if you wrote it); links to the master creative files; and anything else that’s important.

## Overview

This is a place to store any details related to the set up and ongoing management of websites that you control. It’s about the underlying _administration_ of a website. Not what’s on it.

Think about it from the perspective of a new staff member that you’ve asked to look after your website. What are all the little details they need to know?

We also recommend recording any configuration or behind-the-scenes settings. For example, if you’re connecting a domain from a third-party registry on Squarespace, you’ll need to type in the DNS details. Help your future self by noting what you did.

This includes _blogs and communities_. But for simplicity, we’ve focused on websites here. If you do manage a blog or community, just follow the same advice.

## Exceptions

This is not where you produce and store the content that you publish on a website, that happens in [[80-89]] and [[90-99]].

## Also see

Any services related to building or hosting a website, blog, or community are noted in [[14.32]] (e.g. things like Squarespace, Netlify, WordPress, Discourse, Discord).
