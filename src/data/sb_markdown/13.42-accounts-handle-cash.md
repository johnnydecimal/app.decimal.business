## Overview

This is the place to store all formal paperwork and statements for accounts that are used to both receive income and pay expenses.

For most small businesses this will be a traditional bank account – probably your main account. But it might also include other types of specialised account, platform, or app.

Note that in Australia and potentially other countries, companies, partnerships, and trusts must have a business account for tax purposes. Sole traders can use a personal account, but a business account is still recommended. So if you’re just starting out, spend a little time figuring out what kind of account is best for you.

And if you’re a cyborg from the future and only deal with digital currency, then store those records here too.

### What do you mean by ‘formal’ statements and paperwork?

Static documents supplied by a platform or bank (e.g. PDFs). As opposed to raw data that you might download into a spreadsheet and manipulate. Do that kind of work in [[13.21]] or [[13.31]].

### Saving files

We recommend using the year-month method when saving paperwork and statements so everything sorts neatly. And subfolder by account issuer.
