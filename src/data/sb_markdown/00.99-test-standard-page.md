# 00.99 Test standard page

## Description

A page that contains every basic layout element so that I can use it as an automated test target.

Let's see what marked-smartypants is up to. "This" is 'this' but -- two --- and three dashes.

## Paragraphs

This is a paragraph and is the first in its section.

1. This is an ordered
2. list surrounded (and this is a very long list item that will flow)
3. by paragraphs.

Incididunt proident commodo ex tempor ex cupidatat voluptate reprehenderit cupidatat reprehenderit id consequat irure. Est aute commodo enim eiusmod.

- This is an
- unordered list with at least one item long enough to run over
- on to the next line.

Also surrounded by paragraphs. `This text here` is in single-backticks for code.

- This is
- an unordered list
  - with a nested
  - unordered
- list.

## ol:first-child

1. An ordered list that is the first thing in its section.
2. So we need to make sure it lines up with the top.

## ul:first-child

- An unordered list that is the first thing in its section.
- So we need to make sure it lines up with the top.

## blockquote > ol:first-child

The blockquote surrounded by paras.

> 1. First item.
> 2. Second item.

We use these as footnotes.
