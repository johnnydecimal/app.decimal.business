# 14.22 Data

## Description

A summary of the kinds of data you have and where it is.

## Examples

Documents in your computer’s documents folder; notes in a notes app; emails in an email client; other bespoke files in apps, software, or online platforms that you use; real-world data in a ledger or cashbook.

## Overview

Alright, this is important. If you lose this you go out of business. If this gets corrupted or stolen you go out of business.

_Some_ of this data will live on a device you control or a cloud service in [[14.21]]. But it’s likely you’ve got all sorts of stuff in other places. So that's what this ID is for. Recording what your data is and where you're keeping it.

Also, if you use a file synchronisation service, like Syncthing, store details about that here.
