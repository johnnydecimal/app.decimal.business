# 13.51 Inbox and processing of liabilities

## Description

Pay what needs paying, tally up anything outstanding, and file the records.

## Examples

## Overview

Think of this ID like a garden shed. It's where you can do rough work without anyone having to see it.

It contains an inbox where liability records are held until you process and permanently file them in either:

- [[13.52]],
- [[13.53]],
- [[13.54]],
- [[13.55]].

And if you need to do any messy calculations as you process the liabilities, thereâ€™s room here.

## Exceptions

[[13.03+ XXXXXXXX]]

Follow the steps in the ops manual and set up a regular time to process your liabilities inbox.
