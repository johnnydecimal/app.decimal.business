# Configuration notes

We decided that notes related to the configuration of any mobile device in this category would live with the thing itself. For instance, you might have a preferred way to set up staff phones, such as ensuring they all have face ID activated, company wallpaper, and cloud storage and backup. Save those details here for future reference.
