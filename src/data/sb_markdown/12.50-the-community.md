# 12.50 The community

## Description

Youâ€™re part of something bigger â€“ interactions with the neighbourhood, the region, the planet.

## Ops manual

## Examples

## Overview

Your business is part of a wider community â€“ schools, hospitals, clubs, local government and media, the environment, etc. And sometimes it will interact with the community in different ways.

This section isnâ€™t about your core business, your employees, suppliers, or professional bodies. Itâ€™s a place for civics, community engagement, and being a good business citizen. Itâ€™s giving versus getting.

This is a broad umbrella and may not be that relevant for many businesses. But if this sounds like you, then put any relevant contact details, notes, and other documents here.

## Exceptions

## Rationale

After seeing folder structures kindly provided by some business owners, we realised that civics and community engagement can be a big deal.

So we wanted to make sure there was a place for this stuff to keep it separate from daily operations.

Especially if you participate in recurring events. Youâ€™ll want to be able to easily find and reuse certain items each time.
