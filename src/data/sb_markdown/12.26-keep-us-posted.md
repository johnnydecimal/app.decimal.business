## Description

Shipping, postage, and couriers.

## Examples

Post office receipts and tracking numbers; courier accounts; ordering postage supplies like stamps, envelopes, parcel satchels, and packing materials; document exchange (DX) and other business postal services; specialised shipping or air services; dealing with customs and import/export regulations.

## Overview

If you send or receive it and it’s related to back (or front) office operations, manage it here. This is for the day-to-day postage needs that every business has – buying envelopes, popping to the post office, or having a bike courier account.

Realistically this includes front office operations as well. It’s unlikely you’d have different postal requirements for both parts of the business, but who knows. If you do, then there’s plenty of room in [[12.30]] for another ID.

## Exceptions

If shipping your product to customers is a major part of your business, that is managed in [[20-29]].
