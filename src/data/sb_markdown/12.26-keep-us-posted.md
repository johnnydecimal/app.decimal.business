## Description

Shipping, postage, and couriers.

## Ops manual

## Examples

Post office receipts; tracking numbers; courier accounts; document exchange (DX) and other business postal services; ordering postage supplies (like stamps, envelopes, parcel satchels, packing materials, etc.); specialised shipping or air services; dealing with customs and import/export regulations.

## Overview

If you send or receive it and it’s related to back (or front) office operations, manage it here.

Realistically this includes front office operations as well. It’s unlikely you’d have different postal requirements for both parts of the business, but who knows. If you do, then there’s plenty of room in [[12.30]] for another ID.

## Exceptions

This is not for sending your product to customers, that goes in [[20-29]].
