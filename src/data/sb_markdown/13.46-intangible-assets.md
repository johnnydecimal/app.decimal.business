# 13.46 Intangible assets

## Description

Things you own that cannot be touched, like intellectual property, brand equity, and goodwill.

## Examples

Intellectual property such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets; digital assets such as domain names, software, and proprietary technology; goodwill assets such as brand equity and customer loyalty; licences and permits such as taxi medallions, liquor licences, and franchises.

## Overview

This is a place to note any non-physical items you own that are involved in running the business or contribute to its future worth.

These type of assets are classified as ‘intangible’ because you can’t physically touch them.\* Depending on what they are, intangible assets might be much more valuable than any fixed or current assets.

\*For the pedants – in the case of, say, a licence or permit, we’re talking about the concept of the thing here, not a printout of it.
