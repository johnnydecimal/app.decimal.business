# 13.44 Fixed assets

## Description

Things owned for a longer term that help you run the business, like equipment, vehicles, and property.

## Examples

Land; buildings; furniture; machinery; vehicles; computer equipment.

## Overview

This is a place to note any physical items you own for a longer term that are involved in running the business. Longer term means for more than one accounting period (i.e. more than 1 year).

These type of assets are classified as ‘tangible’ because you can physically touch them. And they’re often labelled as ‘property, plant and equipment’ on balance sheets.

Selling this type of asset might be a taxable event so your accountant will want to know about it. They’ll also need to track everything for depreciation purposes. And if you need to deal with repossession of an asset, note that here too.
