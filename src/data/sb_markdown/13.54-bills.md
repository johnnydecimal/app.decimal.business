# 13.54 Bills

## Description

The place to file processed bills.

## Examples

## Overview

We’ve defined a ‘bill’ as something you must make time to pay. It’s outstanding and requires action, probably by a due date. As opposed to expenses that you have already paid for either on the spot (i.e. with a card), or via an automatic payment (i.e. a direct debit).

As per the ops manual, once you’ve processed the bill in [[13.51]], store it here. For example, you have a food truck and receive a one-off bill for extra gas bottles delivered for an event. Put the bill in the liabilities inbox until you process it. Then permanently file it here and, if you want, add a copy to [[12.31]].

We recommend using the year-month method when saving this kind of paperwork so everything sorts neatly. And subfolder by bill issuer.

## Exceptions

These are not expenses that are paid on the spot or automatically, manage those in [[13.30]].
