# 12.0X Supplier library

## Description

A library of real-world or online suppliers of goods and services that you use for your back and/or front office and vehicles.

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place to store contact details, agreements, contracts, and other over-arching records, all neatly templated.

## Exceptions

This is not for specialised suppliers that directly relate to the product or service that you sell, put those in [[20-29]]. For example, if you’re a baker, the flour and seeds to make bread sit with the product. But the napkins provided for customers are part of front office operations.

NOTES:
Note on wall: “This is a collection not a catch all”
Johnny to decide how he feels about these 2 IDs and where they should go
We discussed templating this
Background/contact details, prices, contracts and agreements, ongoing or one-off, preferred suppliers, back up/emergency suppliers, do-not-use suppliers,
Any other records/documents
But ... what happens in operations?
Bills, invoices, receipts; confirmations; delivery receipts; shopping lists
Is this an opportunity to use sub-IDs?
If using JDex, what’s the best way to quickly add things, like to a shopping list?
What is the pattern? Alphabet?
Is this a spreadsheets or other document?
Do what you like, but we can provide guidance with a template?
