# 00-09 The system, onboarding, help & support, etc.

To dos & discussions:

Tick boxes to say you've read and understand a thing.

A disclaimer.

I understand that this is system of organisation and Johnny and Lucy are not business advisers or financial experts. They are not liable for anything that happens to my business. The management of the files I've downloaded from this are my responsibility, etc etc. Includes a link to the overall Shopify-stle disclaimer wording that lives somewhere in the system.

The handling of bills, purchases, and receipts.

13 is where you process bill payments and purchases, for everything. Store a copy of the receipt in the relevant ID elsewhere if you want. Otherwise file it in 13.33 Receipts. And if you do nearly everything in accounting software then as you were, but note that 13 is a place to store stuff that's outside of this software.

Don't clutter every ID talking about this in 'Also see' etc, say it once upfront. "But just so you know upfront, this could apply to any ID that involves money, so make a decision, and leave yourself a JDex note about this decision. Do this for all decisions you made when learning about this system so you remember in future, and staff will know why some things are done a certain way".

The system rationale.

We have rationales for each ID, but we also need some mega rationales about the entire system, why it is the way it is, that are upfront and you tick.

Here is some draft text I began on this earlier:

In [[10-19]], our goal is that these categories could be the foundation of _any_ business, regardless of the product or service you offer. In theory, you should be able to keep the same business structure, but completely change your offering and still use this area. Whereas, [[20-29]] is specific to how you create and market what you sell.

For example, you are a gardener and your registered business structure is 'sole trader'. After 5 years you decide to trade as a freelance hairdresser, another skill you have. You don't want or need to change your structure. Sole trader is fine. And all the other IDs in this area are still relevant, you'll just be saving some revised information in them. The government doesn't care, as long as you keep sending them those tax dollars.

For example, over the years our company, Coruscade, has been used to run a dance production, manage an IT contractor business, and now Johnny.Decimal. Coruscade could have used [[10-19]] to administer any of these businesses. But the dance production and Johnny.Decimal need their own product and marketing areas.

For example, a shell company might have several products and/or operate several business at once. But it just has one batch of government tax reporting. The ‘timber’ business in New Zealand has a similar situation – one entity, several businesses. [[10-19]] is designed to accommodate this scenario.

Other notes I’d made:

- You don’t have to fill the system, most of us won’t use many sections. No front office or business vehicle? That’s ok, many will just have the money and important docs stuff.
- Cover off definition of business/size - includes not-for-profit, clubs, charities, volunteering.

How to handle meetings & communications

An explanation and process/ops manual/how-to/rationale.

Johnny has started to write this and draw diagrams.

Overarching JD concepts

An explanation of key JD concepts and links to the website for further reading.

Because we will just be talking about these things in the text. And if you’re new to Johnny.Decimal, you will be like, huh? For example, the index/JDex - what it is, why it’s great, and that you must actively use it/leave yourself notes. We can’t assume people will have a notes app and understand what an index is without telling them.

Wikilinks.

In 14.14 I left a note to reiterate this text in the help section.

# The power of wiki links in JDex notes

If you are torn about where any accessories should live, don’t stress. Remember that we can create wiki links in our JDex notes to other IDs. If we do this, we’re not going to lose anything.

In the example above, we store our card reader in [[12.34]]. In that JDex note, we add a bullet point that says “The iPad that controls this card reader is at [[14.12]]”.

This advice goes for anything else in your system where there’s a little ambiguity. Links are our friends.

OPS MANUALS

Notes I’d made:

- Which ones will we do for v1?
  - All inboxes, 13.21, 13.31, 13.41, 13.51, 13.61
  - 14.23 Backups & recovery:
    - encryption of customer data
    - how to restore a file from last week in whatever you use
    - Time Machine, Backblaze, call your IT person
- We provide some versus you write some (DIY, so much we can’t know).
- We need a consistent way to tell people how to write their own.
- e.g. 11.23, we’ve suggested a DIY ops manual.

  - It might be a list of things to grab in an emergency in your JDex.
  - Plus other stuff to do, link relevant IDs in this system.
  - Do we need a standard zero for ‘locations’.
  - i.e. All the places you keep important stuff, then can wiki link them.

- Johnny to create a system-wide ops manual for that explains with examples what a static document is versus a changeable document. So you'll just be able to link to an ID vs. having this custom footnote.

See 13 Section header footnote:

\*By ‘static’ we mean things that were sent to you that can’t be changed (e.g. a PDF). As compared to internal files that you work on (e.g. a spreadsheet). You should never have multiple copies of the latter. You’ll end up working on the wrong version and being very sad when you realise. This is not the Decimal way.

- Which ones will we do in future?
  - See notes in most back/front office operations IDs

TEMPLATES AND PATTERNS

Templates we said we’d make, and naming/filing patterns we should recommend.

Folder templates we said we’d make:

- 11.42 Staff record keeping
- 14.20 Storage, data, & backups
- 14.32 External software & services
- 12.0X Supplier library (see notes under this ID)

Other templates we could make someday:

- Related to: 14.32 External software & services
  - A Baserow of all the great software
- Noted in 12.21: create processes and/or template
  - Choose a pattern for the per-site subfolders and for saving/re-naming bills
  - Plus all supplier bills, consistently, using the date to sort

Naming/filing patterns we should recommend:

- Year-month-day
- When to use the alphabet
- What else?

PASSWORDS & SECURITY RELATED

In 14.43 Behavioural cybersecurity, we say not to write down passwords.

Then a comment says:
Other than printing out your recovery kit and storing it in a vault. Complicated to explain … might need to figure out where that goes. Here might not be the best place.

Do we need a help/how-to about recovery?
