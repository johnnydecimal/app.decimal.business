# 12.30 Front office equipment & operations

## Description

Anything that supports the delivery of your product or service (open for business).

## Ops manual

## Examples

If you run a beauty salon, your front office is:

- your shopfront, customer reception area, and treatment rooms.

If you’re a personal trainer, your front office might be:

- a gym where you rent space, or
- a registered area in a park (and your equipment is part of front office operations).

If you’re a freelance writer, your front office might be:

- non-existent because you only meet clients at their office, or
- a co-working space that you meet clients in, or
- the same as your back office, clients come to you for meetings (and the fancy coffee and snacks you offer are part of front office operations).

## More info

By ‘front office’ we mean the part of your business premises that is customer facing and supports the delivery of your product or service.

But it is _not_ the thing you sell. Some industries call this ‘front of house’ if that makes it easier to think about.

For instance:

- A baker’s sausage roll is their product, the branded napkins for customers are a front office supply (and they’re not what staff get in the back office).
- A haircut is a hairdresser’s product, the coffee and biscuits for customers are front office supplies.
- A clean dog is a dog groomer’s product, the hose used to wash it is a front office supply.

It might be an actual office, a retail store, the front of a cafe or bar, or a public space. It’s wherever you interact with your customers and the equipment or services you use during these interactions.

And while many businesses might have a similar back office set-up, your front office will be tailored to you.

## Exceptions

If you do everything in your back office and never interact with customers, this section will be empty. That’s okay.

Parts of this system will be very quiet for many businesses and super busy for others.

For instance, Johnny.Decimal HQ operates solely in a rented back office, with two staff, and no vehicles. Most of our business administration is money-related, and even then, our accountant does the heavy lifting.

When Lucy was a freelance writer, everything happened in her back office – a desk with a laptop. Pretty simple.

## Rationale

As mentioned in [[12.20]], we decided to separate back office and front office because, depending on the business, these areas might have quite different equipment, suppliers, and daily operations.

And different people might manage each area (you don’t want people trying to open the same spreadsheet at the same time).

When we were thinking about this, we often referred to the TV show, The Bear. If you haven’t seen it, it’s about a restaurant in Chicago.

The back office is run by Natalie. She’s in a room with a desk and a computer, sorting out all their administrative chaos.

The front office is run by Richie. He’s in charge of the restaurant area where the customers are and the delivery of the product.

The ‘product’ is run by Carmy. He’s in charge of the kitchen where the food is made, i.e. the product that they sell.

Some business are simpler than this, some might be more complicated. But hopefully this conveys the basic idea of ‘staff only’ versus ‘customer facing’ areas.
