# 13.21 Inbox and processing of income

## Description

Confirm you’ve been paid, tally up earnings, and file the records.

## Examples

## Overview

Think of this ID like a garden shed. It's where you can do rough work without anyone having to see it.

It contains an inbox where income records are held until you process and permanently file them in either:

- [[13.23]],
- [[13.24]],
- [[13.25]],
- [[13.26]].

And if you need to do any messy calculations as you process the income, there’s room here.
