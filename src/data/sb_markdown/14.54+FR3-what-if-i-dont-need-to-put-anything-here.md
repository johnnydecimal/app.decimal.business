# What if I don’t need to put anything here?

This feels like a place to reinforce that there’ll be parts of this system that are busier for some people than others.

For example, you subscribe to a third-party service and send out four email newsletters a year. The service’s existence is noted in [[13.35]], [[14.32]], and [[14.41]]. And now you’re thinking “you want me to make notes about it here too?”.

If you do all your work inside your newsletter platform and have nothing to put here right now, don’t stress. You don’t need to fill IDs just because we made them. _Other people_ will put things here. We want to ensure they have a place.
