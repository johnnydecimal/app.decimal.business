# Configuration notes

We decided that notes related to the configuration of any accessory in this category would live with the thing itself. For instance, when you get a new printer thereâ€™s usually settings to choose and maybe a password. When you get a new monitor, you might choose certain colour, brightness, and energy settings. Record what you did here.
