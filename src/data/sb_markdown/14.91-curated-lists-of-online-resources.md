# 14.91 Curated lists of online resources

## Description

If you have treasured collections of links that you don’t want to lose, store them here.

## Ops manual

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place to store any curated lists of where you go online for business-related information. These lists have probably been developed over time, are specific to your work, and you don’t want to lose them.

Maybe you want to store a copy outside of your browser bookmarks for reasons. Perhaps you want to share them with others. For example, when onboarding new staff you might provide a list of helpful resources like:

- industry newsletters to sign up for,
- trusted websites for research and reading,
- blogs and RSS feeds to follow,
- communities to join,
- YouTube or social media accounts to follow.
- or trade journals to review.

Note that this is a ‘special-case’ ID that happens to be in the technology library. Organise the rest of this library as you wish.

# Rationale

If you keep lists like this, they’ll no doubt contain information relevant to all categories, not just technology. But we’ve recommended putting them here because they’re accessible _on_ technology. And it might be handy to have them all in one ID.

If you actively use your browser bookmarks and keep them well organised, you might not need this ID. But for those of us who don’t, here’s an alternative.
