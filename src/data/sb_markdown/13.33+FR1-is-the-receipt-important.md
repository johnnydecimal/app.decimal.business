# Is the receipt important?

There’ll probably be lots of receipts that you don’t consider to be that important. Such as everyday consumables like petrol or milk for the office fridge. Just keep them all here for however long you’re required to by law.

But for ‘important’ receipts for higher-value items and/or anything with a warranty, you might like to add a copy to where the thing lives in the system. For instance, you buy a new laptop. The receipt sits in the expenses inbox until you process it. You then permanently file it here and also add a copy to [[14.11]].
