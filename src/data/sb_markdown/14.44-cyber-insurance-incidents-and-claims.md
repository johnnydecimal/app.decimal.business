# 14.44 Cyber insurance, incidents, & claims

## Description

Policies, coverage details, incident reports, and claim forms for your digital world.

## Examples

Depending on the policy, cyber insurance may cover costs related to: extortion or ransomware; data breaches and security; loss or release of customer data; interruptions to business operations caused by a cyber event; recovery of lost business data; being sued by a third party for damages caused by a cyber event.

## Overview

This is a place for insurance that covers the business interacting with the digital world. Anything related to being on a computer, including hacks, scams, phishing, data leaks, viruses and malware, or ransomware attacks.

It’s likely you’ll find it easier to obtain cyber insurance (and make a claim) if you can show that you have implemented a cybersecurity plan and have proper password management.

This is also where to store incident reports that might become part of a claim.
