# Saving files for intangible assets

This ID should contain copies of records saved elsewhere in the system. That’s okay because these are static records. We want a place where you and/or your accountant can go to see the proof of ownership and value of any intangible assets in one place.

For instance, a scientist’s R&D and patent are intangible assets:

- She manages the R&D and patent in [[20-29]].
- She copies the key records here for her accountant.
- And she also has a master finance record in [[13.11]] that includes a summary of her intangible assets because that’s how she rolls.
