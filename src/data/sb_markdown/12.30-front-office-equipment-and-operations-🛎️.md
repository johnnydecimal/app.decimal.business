# 12.30 Front office equipment & operations

## Description

Anything that supports the delivery of your product or service (open for business).

## Examples

If you run a beauty salon, your front office is:

- your shopfront, customer reception area, and treatment rooms.

If you’re a personal trainer, your front office might be:

- a gym where you rent space, or
- a registered area in a park (and your equipment is part of front office operations).

If you’re a freelance writer, your front office might be:

- non-existent because you only meet clients at their office, or
- a co-working space that you meet clients in, or
- the same as your back office, clients come to you for meetings (and the fancy coffee and snacks you offer are part of front office operations).

## Overview

By ‘front office’ we mean the part of your business premises that is customer facing and supports the delivery of your product or service. But it is _not_ the thing you sell. Some industries call this ‘front of house’ if that makes it easier to think about.

It might be an actual office, a retail store, the front of a cafe or bar, or a public space. It’s wherever you interact with your customers and the equipment or services you use during these interactions.

And while many businesses might have a similar back office setup, your front office will be tailored to you.
