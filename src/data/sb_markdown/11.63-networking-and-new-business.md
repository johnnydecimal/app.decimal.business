# 11.63 Networking & new business

## Description

Anyone you meet that you might develop a business relationship with one day.

## Examples

## Overview

Whether you meet in person or online, jot down anything important and save it here.

For instance, their name, contact details, what they do, what you discussed, and their social, LinkedIn, or website links. If they gave you their business card, you could take a photo of it and add it to your JDex note or file system.

Consider linking these people to an ID. For example, if theyâ€™re a potential front office supplier, add a link in your JDex to [[12.0X]].
