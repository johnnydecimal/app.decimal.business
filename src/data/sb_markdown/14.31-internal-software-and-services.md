# 14.31 Internal software & services

## Description

Software and services that we create and/or manage.

## Examples

**Internal software** might include things like: a personalised dashboard or widget; a script or complex formula in a spreadsheet; an automation in Airtable; a Zapier workflow; Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) customisations for Microsoft Office;
or any type of in-house software you’ve developed.

The base set of **internal services** that a business might supply to staff includes: user login; internet connectivity; wifi connectivity; printing; file services.

## Overview

By ‘internal software’ we mean any software (fancy or low-code no-code), scripts, or automations you’ve created to help the business. This ID is a place to list anything that you have and where it lives.

By ‘internal service’ we mean anything you can do on a computer because there’s a combination of devices, software, and/or third-party services working together. This ID is a place to describe how the internal service was set up, for the administrator. And instructions for how to connect to the internal service, for users. Which might just be you wearing two different hats.

## Exceptions

This is not for software that you’ve developed for sale – that goes in [[20-29]].
