# Why is product-related shipping not managed here?

This ID is for the daily sending and receiving that most of us do. But if shipping your product to customers is a major part of your business, that is a process that needs its own space in [[20-29]]. Whether you send large freight consignments from a warehouse or run an Etsy shop from home, you’ll have all sorts of things to manage.

For example, a web design agency manages all of their sending here. It’s primarily business administration and they don’t ship physical products to customers. They do things like:

- post signed paperwork to their accountant and lawyer,
- courier brochure artwork proofs to their printer,
- and send the odd parcel.

Conversely, a handmade candle business manages things like sending a letter to their accountant here. And _all_ of their candle shipping in [[20-29]]. They do things like:

- buy pre-paid parcel satchels and packing materials in bulk,
- and print address labels and other collateral material that goes in the parcels.

And a handmade furniture business manages things like sending a letter to their lawyer here. And _all_ of their furniture shipping in [[20-29]]. They do things like:

- deal with domestic air and land freight companies,
- and organise international container shipping and export paperwork.
