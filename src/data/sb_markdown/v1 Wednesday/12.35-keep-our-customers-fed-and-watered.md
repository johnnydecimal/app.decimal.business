# 12.35 Keep our customers fed and watered

## Description

Food, beverage, and kitchen equipment that help us deliver our product or service.

## Ops manual

## Examples

Anything complimentary you provide for customers/clients like tea, coffee, biscuits, lollies, or filtered water; any equipment that you use to prepare complimentary food or beverages for customers.

## Overview

This is all about the nice touches you offer to your customers.

A cup of herbal tea or a glass of Prosecco at a beauty salon. A coffee and a biscuit at a hair salon. A water cooler in the reception area of your dental surgery.

The theme here is that food and beverage is not your core business, it’s a complimentary add-on.

So if you sell food and beverages in a cafe, bar, restaurant, retail shop, market stall, or anywhere else, that goes in [[20-29]].

## Exceptions

If food and/or beverage is the product you sell, that’s managed in [[20-29]].

## Rationale

Depending on how generous you are ;-) ... the teabags and other items for customers are probably fancier than those in the staff break room.

So we made space here to track these items since they might come from different suppliers.
