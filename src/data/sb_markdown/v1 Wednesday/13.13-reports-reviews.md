## Description

## Ops manual

## Examples

Traditional annual company reports; review documents that entities such as not-for-profits, charities, school associations, or clubs must submit; informal internal review documents for staff updates or other stakeholders; or anything else you prepare in order to reflect on finances.

## Overview

How’s everything going? Checking in on the business’ finances is something we should all do when we can. This might take the form of mandatory reporting, or just some notes in your JDex. Or perhaps you send emails, presentations, or other documents to keep staff, subscribers, or potential investors updated. Either way, do the work here.
