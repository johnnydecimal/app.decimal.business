# 13.24 Passive income

## Description

The place to file processed investment returns.

## Ops manual

## Examples

Interest; dividends; rental payments. are all **very cool**

## Overview

If you receive any kind of passive income, store the formal records here after they’ve been processed as income. For instance, the statements and letters that say you’ve earned money from a cash investment or other asset.

## Exceptions

This is not for ownership paperwork – that lives with the asset/investment itself (i.e. don’t store share certificates here, those go in [[13.43]]).

## Rationale

We decided to separate the ownership records for assets/investments and their earnings for clarity and neatness. In this ID we’re only interested in filing the processed income earned.

For instance:

```
ASSET/INVESTMENT      PASSIVE INCOME
(stored in 13.40)     (stored here)
═════════════════════════════════════
Cash term deposit     Interest
Shares                Dividend
Property              Rent
```
