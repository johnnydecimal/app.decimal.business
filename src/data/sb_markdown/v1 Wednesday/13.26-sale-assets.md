# 13.26 Sale of assets

## Description

The place to file processed records for high-value items that were sold by the business.

## Ops manual

## Examples

Land; buildings; computer equipment; furniture; machinery; vehicles.

## Overview

If you sell assets that are owned by the business, store the records here after the income has been processed.

This is the kind of higher-value item that your accountant wants to know about because they’ll need to update your balance sheet.

## Exceptions

This is not the act of selling the asset – manage that where the item lives (i.e. don’t store photos of a car for an online ad here, those go in [[12.41]]).
