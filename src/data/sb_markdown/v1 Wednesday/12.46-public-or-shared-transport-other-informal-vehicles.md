## Description

All the other ways to get around, either shared with the public or that you own and maintain.

## Ops manual

## Examples

Public transport like buses, trains, light rail, taxis, or ferries; ride sharing services; accounts to use share cars, e-scooters, or e-bikes; any other type of informal vehicle you own.

## Overview

This is a place to manage anything to do with using public or shared transport, or owning ‘informal’ vehicles.

As noted earlier, by ‘informal’ we mean the vehicle probably doesn’t need official paperwork like registrations, inspections, or mandatory insurance.

Who knows what other kinds of vehicle are part of your business. If it can be pedalled, stood on, sat on, or pulled along, put it here.

These type of vehicles may or may not have their own insurance. Perhaps they’re covered under a policy related to your home office or other fixed-location premises. If not, store the details here and note it in your JDex.

If you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or unique identifier. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.
