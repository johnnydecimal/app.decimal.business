# 14 Technology

## Description

This category is all about your business in the digital world.

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place to manage all the common computer-y things that most businesses have. Like hardware and software, setting up your online presence, and staying safe in cyberspace.

And to be an honorary IT professional, this includes notes about configuration (i.e. all the stuff you did when you set something up). This is a nice example of â€˜working the Decimal wayâ€™ â€“ keeping notes to help your future self. It might be as simple as bullet points in your JDex or maybe a diagram, depending on what youâ€™re documenting. Now youâ€™ll never forget what you did.

## Exceptions

This category is for managing computer-y things that are common to _most_ businesses. Not for any â€˜computerised machinesâ€™ that are specific to your operations or product, those go in [[12.20]], [[12.30]], or [[20-29]].

This category is for managing _your_ technology. If your product or service is related (e.g. youâ€™re an IT consultant or run a computer repair shop) that goes in [[20-29]].

This category is not for managing technology related to workplace security or access (e.g cameras, passcards), that goes in [[12.22]] or [[12.32]].
