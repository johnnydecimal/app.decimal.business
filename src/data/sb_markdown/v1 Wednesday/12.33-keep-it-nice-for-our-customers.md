# 12.33 Keep it nice for our customers

## Description

Cleaning, gardening, decor, and waste.

## Ops manual

## Examples

Cleaners; paid or municipal garbage collection; paper shredding and recycling; indoor plant watering; outdoor gardening; window washing; music instructions; anything to do with buying general cleaning and hygiene supplies that’s separate to the back office (like fancy hand wash and moisturiser for customer bathrooms); non-structural decorations like framed prints or plastic plants.

## Overview

This is about keeping up appearances and creating a nice environment for your customers.

You might have contracts with suppliers for ongoing services, or you might do everything yourself. Either way, track it all here.

## Exceptions

This is not for repairs and maintenance, that’s in [[12.15]].

This is not for digital music subscriptions, we’ve classified those as ‘technology’ – they live in [[14.32]] and should also be noted in [[13.35]].
