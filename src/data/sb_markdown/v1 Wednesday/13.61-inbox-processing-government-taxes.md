# 13.61 Inbox and processing of government taxes

## Description

Tally up final figures, pay what needs paying, and file the records.

## Examples

## Overview

Think of this ID like a garden shed. It's where you can do rough work without anyone having to see it.

It contains an inbox where government tax records are held until you process and permanently file them in [[13.62]].

And if you need to do any messy calculations as you process government taxes, there’s room here.

## Exceptions

## Rationale

The goal of the five ‘inbox and processing’ IDs in this category is to add a little rigour to ensure you don’t miss anything. Income payments and tax deductible expenses are like treasure. And forgetting to pay other people is bad form – especially the government.

We don’t want to accidentally overlook these things because we’re busy keeping our customers happy. So hopefully these ops manuals will help form good habits around cross-checking incomings and outgoings. And ensuring our data is shipshape for tax time.
