# 11.52 Optional training

## Description

Extra training to gain or maintain a credential that is nice to have, but not mandatory.

## Ops manual

Consider adding these details to official employee records at [[11.42]].

If you have preferred in-person or online training suppliers, store their details at [[12.0X)]].

If the training is based on any ops manuals in [[12.20]] or [[12.30]], ensure any changes are reflected here.

## Rationale

We’ve called this ‘optional’ as it’s the kind of training or credential you might add on to basic requirements. It’s nice to have, it might make you better at your job, but it’s not required by the business or the law.

If you have multiple staff, everyone might do different things depending on their role and skill set. And it may be a formal qualification that is recognised anywhere, as opposed to training that is specific to your business.
