# 12.23 Keep it nice for us

## Description

Cleaning, gardening, decor, and waste removal.

## Ops manual

## Examples

Cleaners; paid or municipal garbage collection; paper shredding and recycling; indoor plant watering; outdoor gardening; window washing; non-structural decorations like framed prints or plastic plants; anything to do with buying general cleaning and hygiene supplies (like kitchen roll, dishwashing liquid, tea towels, sponges, sprays, hand sanitiser, soap dispensers, toilet paper, etc.).

## More info

Whether it’s just you in a home office, or a team of staff in a warehouse, keeping your work area clean and tidy can make a big difference to a long day. 

You might have contracts with suppliers for ongoing services, or you might do everything yourself. 

Or maybe you’re the person who secretly makes those signs with cartoon dogs that say “please unload the dishwasher”. Either way, track it all here.

## Exceptions

This is not for repairs and maintenance, that’s in [[12.15]].
