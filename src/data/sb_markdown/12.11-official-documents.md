# 12.11 Official documents

## Description

The important documents associated with owning, leasing, or selling a business premises with an address.

## Ops manual

## Examples

Leases and renewals; security deposits; inspection reports; purchasing contracts; property deeds; co-working space agreements.

## Overview

This ID is for business premises with an address where you work privately, trade with the public, or just use as storage. It could be a building or land.

You might have more than one fixed location – that’s fine, just use subfolders labelled with the address to separate them. And remember to name files consistently and use the year-month-day method so everything sorts neatly.

This can also include the future, so store your lease applications or property searches here too.

## Exceptions

If your business ‘premises’ is mobile, like a food truck, van, or trailer, manage it down in [[12.40]].

## Rationale

Many businesses do their work out of multiple locations, which might be fixed or mobile.

For instance, an electrician might have a home office and a van. A cafe might have a retail space and a food truck. A personal trainer might have a home office, a van, and a storage unit for their equipment.

So we suggest keeping the fixed locations here and anything mobile below in [[12.40]], even if you mentally lump them together.

Motor vehicles or anything else that can move or be towed have their own types of documentation, so it felt more logical to keep them separate.
