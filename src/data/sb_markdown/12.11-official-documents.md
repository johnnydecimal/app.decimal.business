# 12.11 Official documents

## Description

The important documents associated with owning, leasing, or selling a business premises with an address.

## Examples

Leases and renewals; security deposits; inspection reports; purchasing contracts; property deeds; co-working space agreements.

## Overview

This ID is for business premises with an address where you work privately, trade with the public, or just use as storage. It could be a building or land.

You might have more than one fixed location – that’s fine, just use subfolders labelled with the address to separate them. And remember to name files consistently and use the year-month-day method so everything sorts neatly.

This can also include the future, so store your lease applications or property searches here too.

## Exceptions

If your business ‘premises’ is mobile, like a food truck, van, or trailer, manage it down in [[12.40]].
