# 14.90 Technology library

## Description

A place to put information that’s related to this category, kinda interesting, mostly unimportant, and definitely doesn’t fit elsewhere.

## Examples

## Overview

Caution. This is a place for when there is no other place. Don’t get lazy and dump stuff here that is important and/or has a home elsewhere in the system.

This might be information that you found interesting or might be useful someday. But right now, it’s not strongly related to any other ID. And it would not make sense to clutter an existing ID or create a new one for it.

It’s a library so we want to keep it neat. Label any files with clear descriptions and use the year-month method in case the information is time sensitive.
