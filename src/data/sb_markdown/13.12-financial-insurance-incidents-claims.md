## Overview

This is a place for any insurance that is specific to money. Whether you’ve earned it, are yet to earn it, or have borrowed it.

## Rationale

As mentioned previously, we recommend that insurance details should live next to the thing that is being insured. This will help your brain find things, and ensure other relevant information is nearby if you’re dealing with a claim or policy renewal.
