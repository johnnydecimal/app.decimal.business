# Why did we classify vehicles as formal and informal?

Many businesses manage all kinds of vehicles that are part of their daily operations. But the more we thought about it, we weren’t sure that a one-size-fits-all approach was the right way. So in this section we’ve suggested that vehicles be classified into two buckets – ‘formal’ and ‘informal’.

_Formal_ vehicles include anything that requires official registrations and inspections, whether it’s motorised or not. If it travels on a public road and requires insurance, or does anything serious like carrying passengers or dangerous goods, then manage it in:

- [[12.41]],
- [[12.42]],
- [[12.43]],
- [[12.44]], and
- [[12.45]].

_Informal_ vehicles do not fit the above description. Manage those, as well as any public or shared transportation that your business uses, in [[12.46]].

As always, if you can’t decide what goes where, don’t stress. Just make a decision and note what you did in your JDex. And if you want to discuss our classification, head over to the [[community]].
