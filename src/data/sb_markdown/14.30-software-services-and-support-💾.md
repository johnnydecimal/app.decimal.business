# 14.30 Software, services, & support

## Description

A place to manage all the non-physical things you install or sign in to.

## Examples

## Overview

This section is about the things that sit ‘on top of’ your computers and devices. The stuff that they run. It might be a piece of software that does something on a computer. Or a broader ‘service’ that is made possible by a combination of devices. For instance, a computer, printer, and network work together to provide a printing service.
