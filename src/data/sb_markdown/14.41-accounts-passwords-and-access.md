# 14.41 Accounts, passwords, & access

## Description

A record of all your logins and how you manage account access.

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place to list all of the types of logins you have and who has access to what. It can be handy to have a snapshot of everything, similar to the list in [[13.35]]. We also recommend keeping notes on how you deal with this stuff.

If this ID starts to get busy, consider using the extend-the-end method with the ‘+’ to nest sub-IDs under the parent ID.

**Do not store passwords here.**

The actual logins (i.e. usernames and passwords) should be in a reputable password manager. Or something else that’s encrypted. Never store your passwords in a plain text file. Ask us if you need help with password management.

## Exceptions

Knowing how to set up and disable accounts, and who has access to what, will be handy when onboarding and offboarding staff in [[11.40]].
