# Jeff produces a tangible thing

Jeff owns [Lovett Sundries](https://lovettsundries.com). They manufacture their own range of body-care products, and sell them in-store and online.

Jeff is at the very top-left of our quadrant chart. He **produces** a **physical thing**.

This is how he might use categories `20` through `39`.

## 21 Products & services

> 游릭 Heavily used.

Jeff creates his own line of products. At `21` he stores the recipes and any other information related to the creams and lotions that he manufactures.

## 22 Suppliers & vendors

> 游릭 Heavily used.

Jeff can't make his product without supplies: the raw ingredients that he uses to manufacture it. He keeps records of his suppliers at `21`.

## 23 Equipment & machines

> 游릭 Heavily used.

Jeff really does _make_ his own stuff. He's not just buying it in.

So he has all sorts of machines that help him do that, from wax melters to lotion pourers to paper folders to make the finished product look nice.

## 24 Processes & procedures

> 游릭 Heavily used.

This is where Jeff tracks the _actual making of the thing_. While the recipe for the lotion is at `21`, here he tracks the processes used to make it, and the associated processes such as good manufacturing practice (GMP) and quality control (QC).

## 25 Inventory & stock

> 游릭 Heavily used.

Everything that Jeff buys from a `22 Supplier` is **inventory**, and after he's used it to manufacture a thing, it it becomes **stock** (or **finished goods**).

## 31 Marketing, PR, & communications

> 游릭 Heavily used.

How would anyone know Jeff existed unless he told them? From online campaigns to the A-frame on the pavement outside his store, `31` is the place for all marketing efforts.

## 32 Sales channels

> 游릭 Heavily used.

Without a mechanism to sell his stuff, how could you buy it? Jeff has two primary channels: his physical store, and his Shopify store. He tracks them here.

## 33 Customers & clients

> 游릭 Heavily used.

While Jeff has many customers, as a retail operation he doesn't spend a lot of time tracking them.

His customer data primarily exists in QuickBooks and Shopify. If he needs to extract it to work on it, or if he creates a backup, that data lives here.

- Note: when we say 'heavily used', we don't mean that he's in his file system in folder `33`. We just mean that `customers` are an integral part of Jeff's business.

## 34 Orders & jobs

> 游릭 Heavily used.

Similarly, Jeff's orders are either made in-store, in which case they're immediately fulfilled, or on Shopify, which tracks the status of an order. Either way, this is the place for anything to do with those orders.

- Note: ibid.

## 35 Shipping & fulfilment

> 游릭 Heavily used.

Less relevant for the in-store transactions -- the customer just takes those away with them -- but the Shopify orders need to be sent out to customers. Jeff will have a process that prints labels and notifies the customer that their shipment is on the way. That all lives here.
