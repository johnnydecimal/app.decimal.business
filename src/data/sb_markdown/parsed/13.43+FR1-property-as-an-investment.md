# Property as an investment

To reiterate, we’re not accountants. And when we discussed property ownership, the conversation kept going around in circles.

If you own your business premises that’s a fixed asset. But a lot of us would think, “hey, isn’t that also an investment?”. And vice versa, if the business owns a rental property as an investment, that’s still a fixed asset right?

We’re not going to get involved in international balance sheet science. But we _can_ make a decision about folders.

Our recommendation is:

- If you own your business premises, the title deed lives in [[12.11]] and because it’s a fixed asset, copy it to [[13.44]].
- And if the business also owns a rental property that is _not_ where you trade, we consider that an investment. The rent is your earnings. So the title deed lives here. You could also copy it to [[13.44]] if you prefer.

If this sounds like madness, we can discuss it in the [[community]].
