# Configuration notes

We decided that notes related to the configuration of any network device in this category would live with the thing itself. For instance, an ADSL modem/router needs to be configured so that it broadcasts wifi with a certain password. It has a web interface where you type things in boxes to create the wifi network. Record what you did here.
