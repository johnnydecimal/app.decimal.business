# 13.14 Financial catch-all

## Description

A place for any finance records or documents that definitely don’t fit elsewhere.

## Examples

Documents related to your credit rating and history.

## Overview

Ideally you should be able to find a place for random things below. But it’s not uncommon to get financial documents that are one-offs or don’t fit elsewhere. We don’t know what kind of miscellaneous paperwork is issued to businesses around the world. So we wanted to leave space just in case.

Remember to leave a note in your JDex when you save things in this ID so you can find them easily.

This is an important habit to get into, by the way. Don’t agonise if you’re unsure where something should go. Find the first relevant ID, make a decision, and leave yourself a note. Having a well-maintained JDex means you’ll never lose anything again.

## Exceptions

This is not a place for anything that relates to an account. That paperwork should fit into either:

- [[13.22]],
- [[13.32]],
- [[13.42]],
- [[13.52]],
- [[13.53]],
- [[13.62]],
- or any other accounts you may have.
