# 12.44 Fit-outs, renovations, & improvements (formal)

## Description

A place for larger projects that aren’t general upkeep.

## Examples

Fitting-out a caravan for food service with flooring, cabinetry, utility connections, and a service hatch; renovating a dog grooming van by replacing the sinks, hoses, and taps, and re-waterproofing the interior; installing custom-made, fixed tool boxes in the back of a tradesperson’s ute/truck; mood boards, measurements, and a budget spreadsheet for reupholstering a boat; research, designs, and quotes for a full van signage wrap.

## Overview

This is a place to manage larger projects, specific to vehicles, that have an end. And once done, you move into front or back office operations mode. As such, we recommend that any equipment ordered as part of the project be stored in [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].

If you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or registration. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.

## Exceptions

Repairs, maintenance, and associated purchases go in [[12.45]].

Front or back office equipment ordered as part of a project goes in [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].
