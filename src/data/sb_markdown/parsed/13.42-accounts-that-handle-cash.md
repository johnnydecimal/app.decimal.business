# 13.42 Accounts that handle cash

## Description

The formal statements and paperwork for accounts or platforms that are used for both incomings and outgoings.

## Examples

## Overview

This is the place to store all formal paperwork and statements for accounts that are used to both receive income and pay expenses.

For most small businesses this will be a traditional bank account – probably your main account. But it might also include other types of specialised account, platform, or app. And if you’re a cyborg from the future and only deal with digital currency, then store those records here too.

We recommend using the year-month method when saving paperwork and statements so everything sorts neatly. And subfolder by account issuer.
