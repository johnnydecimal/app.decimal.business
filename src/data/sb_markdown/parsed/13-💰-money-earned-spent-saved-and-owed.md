# 13 ðŸ’° Money earned, spent, saved, & owed

## Description

This category is all about keeping track of your finances, from planning and budgeting, to reconciling and submitting your annual returns.

## Examples

## Overview

First and foremost, remember that weâ€™re not accountants, bookkeepers, or financial advisers. We want to help small businesses be more organised and avoid surprises at tax time. So we made a simple framework to manage finances in. Even if you use accounting software, you still need places to store things and do certain processing tasks.

Our goal is to give you:

- logical buckets to put things in,
- processes to get your data in shape for your accountant,
- advice on saving your records neatly.

There are some accounting terms here. But we didnâ€™t get too technical. If an accountant looked here, we hope theyâ€™d be able to find what they need. Although they might structure and name things differently.

## Exceptions

This category is for managing _your_ finances â€“ if your product or service is related (e.g. youâ€™re an accountant, bookkeeper, or financial adviser) that goes in [[20-29]].
