# 13.25 Assistance, grants, & gifts

## Description

The place to file processed records of financial help or bonuses.

## Examples

Tax relief, credits, or incentives; concessions and allowances; grants and schemes; cash back and refunds; prizes and gifts.

## Overview

If you receive any kind of one-off or ongoing financial assistance, store the records here after the income has been processed. And if you had to apply for it, store the application here too.

This kind of thing often comes from the government, but it might also come from private industry, academia, or anywhere else. Whatever it is, it’s not a loan and you don’t need to pay it back. Hooray.
