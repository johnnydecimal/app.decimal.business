# An example of an income-only account

At JDHQ, we have online courses on a learning platform. They process payments via Stripe. We want to track this account because it contains data that we need to calculate income. And depending on where a customer lives, we may need to pay sales tax on the transaction.

This account is _only_ incomings, we canâ€™t pay expenses with it. It holds money until they release it to a nominated bank account. Therefore, we would store the formal Stripe account statements here.
