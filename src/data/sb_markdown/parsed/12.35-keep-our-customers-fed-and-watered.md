# 12.35 Keep our customers fed and watered

## Description

Food, beverage, and kitchen equipment that help us deliver our product or service.

## Examples

Anything complimentary you provide for customers/clients like tea, coffee, biscuits, lollies, or filtered water; any equipment that you use to prepare complimentary food or beverages for customers.

## Overview

This is all about the nice touches you offer to your customers. A cup of herbal tea or a glass of Prosecco at a beauty salon. A coffee and a biscuit at a hair salon. A water cooler in the reception area of your dental surgery. The theme here is that food and beverage is not your core business, it’s a complimentary add-on.

## Exceptions

If food and/or beverage is the product you sell (e.g. in a cafe, bar, restaurant, retail shop, market stall, or anywhere else), that’s managed in [[20-29]].
