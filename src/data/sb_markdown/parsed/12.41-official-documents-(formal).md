# 12.41 Official documents (formal)

## Description

The important documents associated with owning, leasing, or selling a vehicle.

## Examples

Proof of ownership; government registrations and taxes; financing, leases, and hire-purchase agreements; log books.

## Overview

This is a place to manage anything to do with ‘formal’ vehicles – those that require official paperwork like registrations, inspections, or mandatory insurance. For many businesses this will be cars, vans, and trucks. But it could be anything, motorised or not, depending on what you do and where you trade.

If you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or registration. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.

This can also include the future, so store your new vehicle searches here too.

## Exceptions

This does not include renting a car as part of a business trip. Store that with the trip down in [[15.XX]].
