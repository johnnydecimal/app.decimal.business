# 11.12 Licences, permits, & accreditations

## Description

Documents that you apply for, or are earned via training, so you can legally provide a service or operate in a particular location.

## Examples

Liquor licence; safe food handling certificate; truck or taxi licence; police check; zoning permit; government security clearance; market stall holder permit; working with children check; tradesperson licence; responsible service of alcohol certificate; environmental permit; any other legally-required core qualification.

## Overview

This ID is for storing copies of any licence, permit, or accreditation that your business cannot trade without. First, you registered your business. Now you need the legal proof that you can provide a product or service.

This ‘proof’ will vary considerably depending on what you do. If you run a bar, you’ll need a liquor licence. If you’re a healthcare provider in private practice, you must have a degree, as well as any other required accreditations.

This is an important ID to keep up-to-date in your JDex and to set reminders for so nothing expires.
