# 11.32 External policies

## Description

How the business will behave towards customers, suppliers, and the wider world.

## Examples

Customer service policy; refund policy; retail terms and conditions; privacy policy; disclaimers; timely payment process for suppliers; environmental and sustainability policy; equal opportunity employer statement; anti-slavery or land acknowledgement statements.

## Overview

How do you want your business to be perceived by others? This is a place for figuring this out and writing it down.

We’re not talking about operations as such, or nice things your business might do for the community. It’s for any official policies or statements, or personal stances on how the business will behave.

For instance, on your website you might have administrative policies or social, ethical, or environmental statements. Or maybe you have a policy to use local suppliers and pay their invoices early because you want to support others like you.
