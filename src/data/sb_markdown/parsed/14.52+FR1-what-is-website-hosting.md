# What is website hosting?

Your website is just a bunch of files on a disk somewhere. Your web server (the host) is pointed at those files and is always listening for requests. When someone visits your website, the web server shows them the page. This process is fundamentally unchanged since it was invented in 1991.

There’s nothing stopping you hosting a website yourself. But that’d be daft. What happens when your internet is down or when you move house? And do you really want thousands of people using your home internet connection to access the website?

So instead, there are website hosting services. We use Netlify, but there’s many others. This is their business so you get all sorts of advantages. For example, their web servers are all around the world so people don’t have to connect to a server where we live. That’s all ‘hosting’ is.
