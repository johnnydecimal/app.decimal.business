# Why did you include less frequent running expenses here?

We made a decision to include less frequent purchases up here, such as tyres and spare parts. They’re still running expenses, but you only buy them sporadically. And they tend to be linked directly to a repair or discovered during routine maintenance.

Here they won’t be lost among receipts for daily running expenses like fuel and other consumables. And they’ll be close to maintenance and service records, which may be relevant for warranties or future re-sale value.
