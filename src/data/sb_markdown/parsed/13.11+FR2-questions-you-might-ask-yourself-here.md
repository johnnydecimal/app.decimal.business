# Questions you might ask yourself here

Financial planning is a broad term. If you’re not sure what you might research and plan in this ID, here’s some questions to get started:

- Is my business idea viable?,
- What are my start-up and ongoing operating budgets?,
- What taxes apply to me? (e.g. income, sales, fringe benefits, capital gains, payroll, land, stamp duty),
- What are my financial goals and some strategies to reach them?,
- Will I use digital tools and accounting, time-tracking, or payroll software?,
- Will I rely on a bookkeeper or accountant or do as much as I can myself?,
- What kind of bank account/s do I need?,
- How will I deal with cash? (e.g. currency conversions, cash floats, petty cash, cash books),
- Do I need help protecting profits? (e.g. diversifying investments to reduce risk).
