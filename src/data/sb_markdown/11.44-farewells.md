# 11.44 Farewells

## Description

Anything to do with ending employment and offboarding staff.

## Ops manual

## Examples

The offboarding process and paperwork; checklists for handing things back; exit interview templates; handover documents and meetings; notice periods for resignations, redundancies, or dismissals.

## More info

When staff move on it’s important to have a process in place leading up to their last day – the opposite of onboarding. 

Clearly communicate your expectations of what they need to achieve before they go and what you will do in return. This includes handing the role over to another staff member in a timely manner if required.

While this is a normal part of running a business, it can sometimes be sad or stressful. Review your local employment laws if you have to deal with a dismissal or redundancy. And remember to seek advice or support if you need help.

## Exceptions

Calculate final payouts over in [[13.34]] and record the details in [[11.42]] to close the loop.

If you organise a farewell social gathering or gift, that goes in [[15.XX]].
