# 13.52 Cash loan accounts

## Description

The place to file processed statements and other formal paperwork for any cash accounts that you owe money to.

## Ops manual

## Examples

Credit card; mortgage; line of credit; overdraft; promissory note; commercial bill/bill of exchange; any other formal cash loan; refinancing paperwork; any form of investor financing that must be repaid.

## Overview

You owe someone money because they lent you money.

After payments are processed, file the records here using the year-month method so everything sorts neatly. And subfolder by account issuer.

## Exceptions

## Also see

If an investor also receives equity, manage that in [[13.64]].

## Rationale

We made a decision to include any sort of repayable investor financing here as a cash loan account. Depending on who it’s from, it might not be set up like a typical bank loan account. But you’ll still have some form of repayment obligations and/or ‘statements’ to track, process, and file.
