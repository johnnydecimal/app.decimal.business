## Rationale

Many businesses manage all kinds of vehicles that are part of their daily operations. But the more we thought about it, we werenâ€™t sure that a one-size-fits-all approach was the right way.

So in this section weâ€™ve suggested that vehicles be classified into two buckets â€“ â€˜formalâ€™ and â€˜informalâ€™.

Formal vehicles include anything that requires official registrations and inspections, whether itâ€™s motorised or not.

If it travels on a public road and requires insurance, or does anything serious like carrying passengers or dangerous goods, then manage it in [[12.41]], [[12.42]], [[12.43]], [[12.44]], and [[12.45]].

Informal vehicles do not fit the above description. Manage those, as well as any public or shared transportation that your business uses, in [[12.46]].

If you disagree with this classification, do what works for you and note where everything is in your JDex.
