# 13.24 Passive income

## Description

The place to file processed investment returns.

## Examples

Interest; dividends; rental payments.

## Overview

If you receive any kind of passive income, store the formal records here after they’ve been processed as income. For instance, the statements and letters that say you’ve earned money from a cash investment or other asset.

## Exceptions

This is not for ownership paperwork – that lives with the asset/investment itself (i.e. don’t store share certificates here, those go in [[13.43]]).
