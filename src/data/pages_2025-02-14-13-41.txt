00-09 The system, onboarding, help & support, etc.


To dos & discussions:


Tick boxes to say you‚Äôve read and understand a thing.


A disclaimer. 

I understand that this is system of organisation and Johnny and Lucy are not business advisers or financial experts. They are not liable for anything that happens to my business. The management of the files I‚Äôve downloaded from this are my responsibility, etc etc. Includes a link to the overall Shopify-stle disclaimer wording that lives somewhere in the system.


The handling of bills, purchases, and receipts.

13 is where you process bill payments and purchases, for everything. Store a copy of the receipt in the relevant ID elsewhere if you want. Otherwise file it in 13.33 Receipts. And if you do nearly everything in accounting software then as you were, but note that 13 is a place to store stuff that‚Äôs outside of this software.

Don‚Äôt clutter every ID talking about this in ‚ÄòAlso see‚Äô etc, say it once upfront. ‚ÄúBut just so you know upfront, this could apply to any ID that involves money, so make a decision, and leave yourself a JDex note about this decision. Do this for all decisions you made when learning about this system so you remember in future, and staff will know why some things are done a certain way‚Äù. 


The system rationale.

We have rationales for each ID, but we also need some mega rationales about the entire system, why it is the way it is, that are upfront and you tick.

Here is some draft text I began on this earlier:

In [[10-19]], our goal is that these categories could be the foundation of _any_ business, regardless of the product or service you offer. In theory, you should be able to keep the same business structure, but completely change your offering and still use this area. Whereas, [[20-29]] is specific to how you create and market what you sell.

For example, you are a gardener and your registered business structure is ‚Äòsole trader‚Äô. After 5 years you decide to trade as a freelance hairdresser, another skill you have. You don‚Äôt want or need to change your structure. Sole trader is fine. And all the other IDs in this area are still relevant, you‚Äôll just be saving some revised information in them. The government doesn‚Äôt care, as long as you keep sending them those tax dollars.

For example, over the years our company, Coruscade, has been used to run a dance production, manage an IT contractor business, and now Johnny.Decimal. Coruscade could have used [[10-19]] to administer any of these businesses. But the dance production and Johnny.Decimal need their own product and marketing areas.

For example, a shell company might have several products and/or operate several business at once. But it just has one batch of government tax reporting. The ‚Äòtimber‚Äô business in New Zealand has a similar situation ‚Äì one entity, several businesses. [[10-19]] is designed to accommodate this scenario.


Other notes I‚Äôd made:
- You don‚Äôt have to fill the system, most of us won‚Äôt use many sections. No front office or business vehicle? That‚Äôs ok, many will just have the money and important docs stuff.
- Cover off definition of business/size - includes not-for-profit, clubs, charities, volunteering.

How to handle meetings & communications

An explanation and process/ops manual/how-to/rationale.

Johnny has started to write this and draw diagrams.

Overarching JD concepts


An explanation of key JD concepts and links to the website for further reading. 

Because we will just be talking about these things in the text. And if you‚Äôre new to Johnny.Decimal, you will be like, huh? For example, the index/JDex - what it is, why it‚Äôs great, and that you must actively use it/leave yourself notes. We can‚Äôt assume people will have a notes app and understand what an index is without telling them.


Wikilinks.

In 14.14 I left a note to reiterate this text in the help section.

# The power of wiki links in JDex notes

If you are torn about where any accessories should live, don‚Äôt stress. Remember that we can create wiki links in our JDex notes to other IDs. If we do this, we‚Äôre not going to lose anything. 

In the example above, we store our card reader in [[12.34]]. In that JDex note, we add a bullet point that says ‚ÄúThe iPad that controls this card reader is at [[14.12]]‚Äù.

This advice goes for anything else in your system where there‚Äôs a little ambiguity. Links are our friends.


OPS MANUALS

Notes I‚Äôd made:
- Which ones will we do for v1?
	- All inboxes, 13.21, 13.31, 13.41, 13.51, 13.61
	- 14.23 Backups & recovery:
		- encryption of customer data
		- how to restore a file from last week in whatever you use
		- Time Machine, Backblaze, call your IT person
- We provide some versus you write some (DIY, so much we can‚Äôt know).
- We need a consistent way to tell people how to write their own.
- e.g. 11.23, we‚Äôve suggested a DIY ops manual. 
	- It might be a list of things to grab in an emergency in your JDex.
	- Plus other stuff to do, link relevant IDs in this system.
	- Do we need a standard zero for ‚Äòlocations‚Äô.
	- i.e. All the places you keep important stuff, then can wiki link them.

- Johnny to create a system-wide ops manual for that explains with examples what a static document is versus a changeable document. So you'll just be able to link to an ID vs. having this custom footnote.

See 13 Section header footnote: 

*By ‚Äòstatic‚Äô we mean things that were sent to you that can‚Äôt be changed (e.g. a PDF). As compared to internal files that you work on (e.g. a spreadsheet). You should never have multiple copies of the latter. You‚Äôll end up working on the wrong version and being very sad when you realise. This is not the Decimal way.

- Which ones will we do in future?
	- See notes in most back/front office operations IDs 

TEMPLATES AND PATTERNS

Templates we said we‚Äôd make, and naming/filing patterns we should recommend.

Folder templates we said we‚Äôd make:
- 11.42 Staff record keeping
- 14.20 Storage, data, & backups
- 14.32 External software & services
- 12.0X Supplier library (see notes under this ID)

Other templates we could make someday:
- Related to: 14.32 External software & services
	- A Baserow of all the great software
- Noted in 12.21: create processes and/or template
	- Choose a pattern for the per-site subfolders and for saving/re-naming bills
	- Plus all supplier bills, consistently, using the date to sort

Naming/filing patterns we should recommend:
- Year-month-day
- When to use the alphabet
- What else?

PASSWORDS & SECURITY RELATED

In 14.43 Behavioural cybersecurity, we say not to write down passwords.

Then a comment says:
Other than printing out your recovery kit and storing it in a vault. Complicated to explain ‚Ä¶ might need to figure out where that goes. Here might not be the best place.

Do we need a help/how-to about recovery?

# 11.11 Structure & registrations

## Description

Proof of the business‚Äô existence, trading structure, and name ‚Äì where it all begins!

## Examples

Business entity registrations; trading name registrations; income and sales tax registrations; trademark records for trading names; company director identity applications.

--

## Overview

This ID is about your business being born. Think of it like your birth certificate and proof of name. Deciding on a trading structure and name are the first steps to starting a business. This affects how you will operate and the various obligations you will have, especially government taxes.

Whether you want to trade alone under your own name, or as a company with staff and its own name, you will have to complete certain registrations to ‚Äòexist‚Äô. The more complicated the structure, the more paperwork there will be. But for many people with simple structures, once you‚Äôre set up, this ID should be pretty quiet (apart from ensuring registrations stay active). 

## Exceptions

Put product or brand-related patents, trademarks, and copyrights in [[20-29]].

## Also see

## Further reading

# Why is my product IP not here?

This ID is _not_ related to your product or service. You might conduct different types of business under one entity. Hence, we recommend that any trademark records for the business name should go here. But if you have other patents, trademarks, or copyrights, they should live with the things they protect.

# 11.12 Licences, permits, & accreditations

## Description

Documents that you apply for, or are earned via training, so you can legally provide a service or operate in a particular location.

## Examples

Liquor licence; safe food handling certificate; truck or taxi licence; police check; zoning permit; government security clearance; market stall holder permit; working with children check; tradesperson licence; responsible service of alcohol certificate; environmental permit; any other legally-required core qualification.

## Overview

This ID is for storing copies of any licence, permit, or accreditation that your business cannot trade without. First, you registered your business. Now you need the legal proof that you can provide a product or service. 

This ‚Äòproof‚Äô will vary considerably depending on what you do. If you run a bar, you‚Äôll need a liquor licence. If you‚Äôre a healthcare provider in private practice, you must have a degree, as well as any other required accreditations.

This is an important ID to keep up-to-date in your JDex and to set reminders for so nothing expires.

## Exceptions

# Keeping copies of ‚Äòstatic‚Äô documents

You might be thinking, ‚Äúhey Johnny Decimal, you‚Äôve always said not to have copies of things in different places‚Äù. Absolutely ‚Äì for documents that _change_, like a budget spreadsheet. You should never have multiple copies of things like that because someone will inevitably update the wrong version. 

However, licences, permits, and accreditations are static documents. Probably a PDF or a piece of paper. It‚Äôs okay to put copies of them where it‚Äôs helpful and makes sense to do so. They‚Äôre not going to change unless they are renewed. 

# Why did we create this ID?

If an inspector turns up at your door, having copies of these core documents in one place will be very handy. They‚Äôre also highly visible at the top of your system so they‚Äôre not lost or forgotten.

# 11.13 Compliance

## Description

Any laws, codes, or standards relevant to your business, including inspections and audits that may be required.

## Examples

Workplace health and safety compliance; environmental laws; industry manufacturing standards; payroll governance; building standards and safety inspections; retail fair trading laws; codes of conduct for advertising and marketing; food safety inspections; financial audits; local and international import/export regulations; laws around the supply of alcohol; employment and unfair dismissal laws; privacy and data protection laws.

## Overview

You have a registered business and the legal permission to provide a product or service. Now you must adhere to the regulatory environment that you are trading in. Again, this will depend entirely on what you do. There may be many different local, state, national, or international laws or requirements to be aware of. 

Compliance might mean that:
- Your business must obey certain laws, regulations, or codes of practice.
- Your business must undergo one-off or ongoing inspections or audits. 
- You and your staff must do ongoing training.
- The products you sell or manufacture must meet certain standards.

Either way, store copies of regulations and proof that you‚Äôre complying with them here. This is an important ID to keep up-to-date in your JDex and to set reminders for so you stay above board.

## Exceptions

# 11.14 Other legal matters

## Description

A place for any other legal matters or ‚Äòserious‚Äô documents related to the business entity that a lawyer may have prepared, were issued by the government, or certified by a public official.

## Examples

Statutory declarations; affidavits; documents related to proof of ownership; non-disclosure or confidentiality agreements; change of company director paperwork; contracts that don‚Äôt fit elsewhere; financial disputes that make it to court.

## Overview

It‚Äôs hard to predict what other core documents a business may have around the world. Or any legal matters that may need to be dealt with. But if it‚Äôs important and doesn‚Äôt fit elsewhere, put it here in this legal catch-all. And note its location in your JDex.

## Exceptions

We‚Äôre still dealing with the business entity here, not employees, products, or suppliers. Any legal matters or ‚Äòserious‚Äô documents related to those things live with them.

# 11.15 Selling it or closing it

## Description

Whether you sell the business, pass it on to a family member, or close it down, this is a place to work out the details.

## Examples

## Overview

Businesses can end for many reasons, happy, sad, or indifferent. 

You might want to retire or just try something new. Or perhaps another business is interested in a merger or acquisition. Or there may be involuntary reasons like bankruptcy or a natural disaster.

We haven‚Äôt seen the TV show ‚ÄòSuccession‚Äô, but we get the gist. This kind of planning would also be something to consider here. Hopefully your situation is less dramatic.

And even if you‚Äôre a sole trader with a simple setup, there might be things for you to store here. For instance, you decide to return to regular employment and want to deregister or pause your business entity to avoid ongoing fees or tax obligations.

# 11.21 Business plan

## Description

## Examples

## Overview

This may be less relevant if you‚Äôre, say, a freelance graphic designer working on a project-by-project basis. But for most other businesses, whether new or existing, this is something you shouldn‚Äôt skip.

A business plan contains all the good stuff like your mission and vision statements, goals, risk analysis, and financial position. Do periodic reviews and remember to save the previous version of the document when updating it. And if you have innovative services or practices, you may wish to protect the plan with a confidentiality agreement. 

If you‚Äôve never written one, government business websites often have handy templates to get you started.

## Exceptions

# 11.22 Business insurance, incidents, & claims

## Description

Policies, coverage details, incident reports, and claim forms for your business entity and people.

## Examples

Public liability insurance; professional indemnity insurance; workers compensation insurance.

## Overview

This is a place for any insurance that covers the business entity interacting with the world. And overall coverage for staff while they are at work. Some of these insurances may be required by law. For instance, in Australia public liability and workers compensation insurance are compulsory.

This is also where to store incident reports that might become part of a claim. For example, if a staff member is injured at work put the details and medical report here. 

## Exceptions

Staff health insurance as part of a salary package goes in [[13.34]].

Building (structural and/or contents) or land insurance goes in [[12.12]].

# There‚Äôs a lot of insurance out there

We can‚Äôt advise you on what to get. But one thing we‚Äôve learned in our research is that there are _a lot_ of business insurance options. It‚Äôs a bit overwhelming. We now understand the value of a trustworthy insurance professional to provide tailored advice.

We‚Äôve also noticed that insurance companies often have commercial policies that are designed for certain occupations. So it might pay to look around to see if that‚Äôs an option for you.

# Why is business insurance here?

We recommend that insurance details should live next to the thing that is being insured. This will help your brain find things, and ensure other relevant information is nearby if you‚Äôre dealing with a claim or policy renewal. Hence, business insurance goes up here and there‚Äôs room allocated for other insurances in the categories below.

# 11.23 Risk & emergency management plans

## Description

Awareness of the risks that can affect your business and instructions for what to do if they occur.

## Examples

## Overview

It‚Äôs important to identify events that can negatively impact your business. And then plan how to make decisions and operate during the event, and recover afterwards (often referred to as ‚Äòbusiness continuity and disaster recovery‚Äô). Your future self will thank you for having a process in place if disaster strikes. 

A business risk might be specific to your product or service. While emergencies might be location-specific natural disasters, human-caused events like crime, or municipal events like a water main rupturing.

For example, if you sell croissants, your risk management plan might include what to do if the price of butter rises. If your business is next to a river, your emergency management plan might include flood evacuation procedures.

Either way, don‚Äôt forget to securely store contact numbers for local emergency, police, fire, and ambulance services, as well as recovery contacts for things like insurance, banking, and suppliers.

## Exceptions

## Also see

Ensure you can access a _printed_ copy of your data recovery instructions from [[14.23]] in the event that something bad happens to your computers (e.g. theft, accident, natural disaster, ransomware attack).

# Do you need an emergency digital recovery kit?

Another risk you might consider here is ‚Äì what if something happens to you? Who do you trust the most to log in to things, pay bills, and contact people on your behalf?

In our [Life Admin System](https://jdcm.al/14.11/), we discuss the concept of an emergency digital recovery kit. Which is basically just a list of instructions, stored in a secure location, that outlines your digital life for a trusted person in an emergency. In this case, it‚Äôs for your business. 

This will obviously contain sensitive information, so don‚Äôt leave it lying around! There‚Äôs a good chance that your password manager can help you manage this kind of thing securely.

# 11.31 Internal policies

## Description

How the business will behave towards staff and expectations for staff behaviour.

## Examples

Company values; enterprise or other registered agreements between employers and employees; formal policies that staff will be assessed against during reviews; how you communicate news and updates; dress code and grooming expectations; buddy systems for new staff; culture-related policies on things like working from home, pets or kids in the workplace, or social activities.

## Overview

What sort of workplace do you want to have? This is a place for figuring this out and writing it down. 

For instance, official policies for how staff can expect to be treated and should behave. General processes around internal communications or managing a team. Staff-retention strategies to help everyone feel comfortable, get along, and enjoy their work.

If you‚Äôre a sole trader, maybe you decide on some internal policies with yourself (why not!). Such as what your working hours are, how often you will check email or other channels, taking regular days off to avoid burn out, or making time for business admin each week. Anything that maintains morale and keeps you motivated.

For instance, on your website you might have administrative policies or social, ethical, or environmental statements. Or maybe you have a policy to use local suppliers and pay their invoices early because you want to support others like you.

# 11.42 Staff record keeping

## Description

The official staff records that a business must keep for a certain period of time, neatly templated.

## Examples

## Overview

In Australia, staff records must be kept for up to 7 years. Your government may have different requirements. 

We recommend that each employee has a subfolder labelled with the year-month-day they joined (so it sorts neatly) and their name. Inside that is a standard template. We have provided an example template in the folder system. Adjust this to your needs as required, just remember to be consistent.

## Exceptions

# 11.43 Formal reviews

## Description

How‚Äôs everybody doing?

## Examples

Performance review templates; completed forms from staff; the follow-up process; resources and strategies for managing underperformance or misconduct; how you deliver warnings and disciplinary action. 

## Overview

Getting the best out of your people includes being open about your expectations for their performance, periodically reviewing it, and ensuring they have an opportunity to speak freely about how things are for them.

Conducting formal reviews against pre-defined criteria is now commonplace. Most people expect to be reviewed during their employment and might think it was odd if they weren‚Äôt. 

Plus if a relationship sours, having evidence that the employee had opportunities to voice concerns and they were taken seriously can be an important protection for business owners.

## Description

Anything to do with ending employment and offboarding staff.

## Examples

## Overview

When staff move on it‚Äôs important to have a process in place leading up to their last day ‚Äì the opposite of onboarding. 

Clearly communicate your expectations of what they need to achieve before they go and what you will do in return. This includes handing the role over to another staff member in a timely manner if required.

While this is a normal part of running a business, it can sometimes be sad or stressful. Review your local employment laws if you have to deal with a dismissal or redundancy. And remember to seek advice or support if you need help.

Animals play an important role in many businesses, including in tourism, agriculture, search and rescue, pest control, and assistance and companionship. So we didn‚Äôt want to forget them. If you need this ID, you know who you are.

We‚Äôre not experts so it‚Äôs hard to predict what subfolders might be useful here. It will depend on the animals you have, what they do, and where you live.

If animals are integral to your business and you need more room, feel free to use the spare IDs in this section. We‚Äôd love to know more about this, so come and chat to us in the [[community]]. We‚Äôll help you get the best result, which will help others who need this too.

## Exceptions

If you‚Äôre a farmer and sell livestock or other animal products such as wool, milk, eggs, or genetic material for breeding, then how you manage all of that should be in [[20-29]] or another area that you create yourself (we can help!).

# Why classify animals as staff?

This ID was included to accommodate animals in exactly the same way as humans ‚Äì in the delivery of a business‚Äô product or service. We appreciate that there‚Äôll be some grey areas here depending on what you do. And we don‚Äôt want things to get confusing. 

For example, if you run a sheep property or dairy farm and sell the wool/milk, it would probably be impractical to classify these animals as staff. 

But if you run, say, a Hansom cab or sled dog tourism business, you might classify the horses or dogs as staff and manage them here. But the thing you‚Äôre selling is the _experience_ of riding around New York‚Äôs Central Park or a snowscape in northern Canada, which is managed in [[20-29]].

# 11.51 Mandatory training

## Description

The basic, compulsory training that must be done, including general training common to many workplaces or that is specific to yours. 

## Examples

Fire drills and general safety training; job-specific software or equipment training; keeping a first aid qualification up-to-date; getting a safe food handling certificate; how to run the reception desk of a dental surgery; on-the-job training during an apprenticeship; how to open and close a cafe or set up a food truck; any other mandatory role-based training, certifications, or competencies.

## Overview

This kind of training has an ‚Äòend‚Äô. There‚Äôs a list of things to tick off and achieve. And what‚Äôs mandatory for some staff may not be for others. Everyone might need to show they can lift a box safely, but only the IT person has to have a particular Microsoft certification. 

Some mandatory training will need to be maintained or renewed. For example, demonstrating first aid skills periodically to keep a qualification.

## Exceptions

If the training is core to the business operating legally, add the proof of completion to [[11.12]].

If the training helps meet compliance obligations, add the proof of completion to [[11.13]].

If you have preferred in-person or online training suppliers, store their details at [[12.0X]].

If the training is based on ops manuals in [[12.20]] or [[12.30]], ensure any changes to those manuals are reflected here.

# Why did you call this mandatory training?

We‚Äôve called this ‚Äòmandatory‚Äô as it‚Äôs the kind of training you tend to be given as a new employee. Or it might be required due to workplace compliance laws. Or it‚Äôs related to how you or staff are expected to do their job. Either way, it must be done.

# 11.53 Other learning & self-improvement

## Description

A place to record any other general learning that doesn‚Äôt fit elsewhere.

## Examples

Materials you collect at industry conferences; notes in your JDex from YouTube software tutorials; a list of business-related books you plan to read; presentations from webinars or Meetups you attended; paid media subscriptions like specialty podcasts, blogs, newsletters, journals, periodicals, and magazines.

## Overview

A place for anything you might classify as learning or self-improvement that doesn‚Äôt fit elsewhere. It‚Äôs not related to your business operating legally and/or doesn‚Äôt lead to a formal credential. You don‚Äôt have to do it, it‚Äôs extracurricular. But it might help you be a better business owner or staff member. 

For instance, informal courses, conferences or workshops, coaching programs, webinars, talks, or general reading and media consumption that keeps you informed.

As an aside, we know some businesses that include budgets for this kind of thing in salary packages. Staff can then spend this on whatever learning they choose. Nice.

# 11.90 ‚ñ† The business & its people library üìö

## Description

A place to put information that‚Äôs related to this category, kinda interesting, mostly unimportant, and definitely doesn‚Äôt fit elsewhere.

## Examples

## Overview

Caution. This is a place for when there is no other place. Don‚Äôt get lazy and dump stuff here that is important and/or has a home elsewhere in the system.

This might be information that you found interesting or might be useful someday. But right now, it‚Äôs not strongly related to any other ID. And it would not make sense to clutter an existing ID or create a new one for it.

It‚Äôs a library so we want to keep it neat. Label any files with clear descriptions and use the year-month method in case the information is time sensitive.

## Exceptions
## Also see

## Further reading

# Why did you include a library in each category?

We wanted to be realistic and acknowledge that sometimes there is miscellanea that accumulates over time. It could be anything ‚Äì a document, photo, URL, email, note, or a physical item. But it‚Äôs not the _work_ that you do. It‚Äôs things that you‚Äôve found online or in real life, or perhaps that you‚Äôve created. 

It doesn‚Äôt fit anywhere else. It‚Äôs just a thing you wanted to save. And you don‚Äôt want it muddying other folders where work happens. Importantly, it‚Äôs not that important. It has nothing to do with business operations. If it wasn‚Äôt backed up it wouldn‚Äôt matter. If you lose it, you could probably download it again.

# Why are there no IDs here?

It‚Äôs difficult to imagine how these libraries might be used. So we didn‚Äôt want to commit to IDs yet. By leaving these sections blank, we can introduce everyone to the careful consideration that goes into making a new ID. 

If you‚Äôre ready to save things in this library, come over to the [[community]] and see what others are doing. Or ask us for advice. We‚Äôll figure it out together and eventually settle on some standard IDs. In the meantime, just keep things neat and tidy here.

# Leave yourself JDex notes

Remember to leave a note in your JDex when you save things in this library so you can find them easily. This is an important habit to get into, by the way. Don‚Äôt agonise if you‚Äôre unsure where something should go. Find the first relevant ID, make a decision, and leave yourself a note. Having a well-maintained JDex means you‚Äôll never lose anything again.

# Why have a supplier library?

It‚Äôs hard to know how every business interacts with their suppliers. But we designed this ID to be a master reference that is kept separate from daily operations. 

This might be useful for shared workplaces or when new staff join, so people can easily find background information. Or if different staff deal with different areas of the business (e.g. daily operations versus the product) so you don‚Äôt have the same files open.

Think of it as a place that is more ‚Äòstatic‚Äô versus the incoming and outgoing orders, confirmations, invoices, and receipts that you deal with day to day. 

And these might be the kind of suppliers that many businesses share, like tradespeople, cleaners, and mechanics. Whereas suppliers that contribute directly to your product are specific to you.

Here‚Äôs some examples of general suppliers for basic operations.

**Building and maintenance** ‚Äì real estate agent; tradespeople; insurance broker.

**Office and operations** ‚Äì utilities; cleaning and bathroom services; couriers and postal services; security; waste removal; stationery and other office equipment; tea/coffee and other kitchen supplies.

**Vehicles** ‚Äì mechanics; tyres, accessories, and spare parts retailers; panel beating and body repairs; painting and sign writing; custom alterations.

## Description

The important documents associated with owning, leasing, or selling a business premises with an address.

## Examples

Leases and renewals; security deposits; inspection reports; purchasing contracts; property deeds; co-working space agreements.

## Overview

This ID is for business premises with an address where you work privately, trade with the public, or just use as storage. It could be a building or land. 

You might have more than one fixed location ‚Äì that‚Äôs fine, just use subfolders labelled with the address to separate them. And remember to name files consistently and use the year-month-day method so everything sorts neatly. 

This can also include the future, so store your lease applications or property searches here too.

# Why did you separate fixed and mobile business premises?

Many businesses do their work out of multiple locations, which might be fixed or mobile. For instance, an electrician with a home office and a van. A cafe with a retail space and a food truck. A personal trainer with a home office, van, and storage unit for their equipment. 

So we suggest keeping the fixed locations here and anything mobile below in [[12.40]], even if you mentally lump them together. Motor vehicles or anything else that can move or be towed have their own types of documentation, so it felt more logical to keep them separate.

# 12.12 Office insurance, incidents, & claims

## Description

Policies, coverage details, incident reports, and claim forms for your business premises and contents.

## Examples

## Overview

When we say ‚Äòoffice‚Äô, we mean whatever your fixed business premises means to you. Whether you have a room in your house, a commercial warehouse lease, or own a bakery, this is where the insurance for that address goes. 

And if you store equipment in both a fixed and mobile location, there might be some overlap here. Just do what makes sense to you. For instance, if you‚Äôre a plumber your equipment might be insured in your home garage and also in your van. If these are separate policies then save them where relevant. 

This is also a place to save incident reports that might become part of a claim. For example, something is stolen and you file a police report. 

## Exceptions

If your business ‚Äòpremises‚Äô is mobile, like a food truck, van, or trailer, put the insurance details in [[12.42]].

If you‚Äôre a market stall holder or similar, store your equipment in [[12.30]] and your public liability insurance in [[11.22]].

If you‚Äôre a digital nomad with no fixed location, you might cover your valuables under a personal travel insurance policy.

## Also see

Having an up-to-date inventory at [[12.0X]] will be helpful if you need to make a claim. 

If you have separate insurance for high-value computers, devices, or accessories, you might decide to store that down in [[14.44]].

# 12.13 Rates, taxes, & fees

## Description

The unavoidable bills and levies associated with owning, leasing, or selling a business premises.

## Examples

Local council rates; government land tax; capital gains tax; stamp duty; body corporate/owner‚Äôs corporation fees for multi-occupancy properties; legal fees; local environmental taxes.

## Overview

This is a place for managing any fees that you can‚Äôt get out of. They might be imposed by the government. Or perhaps by an organisation that manages shared premises, such as a shopping centre, office block, or industrial estate.

Whether leasing or buying a property, ensure you‚Äôre clear on what mandatory one-off and ongoing fees you‚Äôll need to account for in your running costs. For instance, there can be extra fees associated with commercial and retail leases versus residential leases. 

And watch out for unscrupulous landlords asking for illegal fees. We recently learned about the practice of asking for ‚Äòkey money‚Äô when signing retail leases. This is prohibited in Australia and might also be wherever you are.

# 12.14 Fit-outs, renovations, & improvements

## Description

A place for larger projects that aren‚Äôt general upkeep.

## Examples

Fitting-out a hair salon with walls, flooring, cabinetry, sinks, and a kitchen area; renovating a warehouse‚Äôs plumbing, ventilation, and concrete floor, and upgrading the internet connection; installing custom-made, fixed benches and planter boxes at the front of a bar; improvements to a workshop in a home garage that include building a new workbench and fixed shelving; mood boards, measurements, and a budget spreadsheet for repainting a cafe.

## Overview

This is a place to manage larger structural projects that have an end. And once done, you move into back or front office operations mode. As such, we recommend that any equipment ordered as part of the project be stored in those sections.

This ID might be empty for many businesses. Like us. Our office is a room in a rented house. We will never be renovating it. However, it will be very busy for others. The hair salon above is based on a friend who spent a hectic 6 months fitting out a new space.

## Exceptions

Daily fix-its and ongoing maintenance goes in [[12.15]].

Back or front office equipment ordered as part of a project goes in [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].

Fit-outs and renovations for mobile premises go in [[12.44]].

# Why did you separate equipment from the overall building project?

We made a decision that these projects are about building and installing things that you can‚Äôt really take with you ‚Äì they were designed for a specific location ‚Äì and they‚Äôre unlikely to have an ops manual. For instance, a built-in shelf.

Whereas back or front office _equipment_ ordered as part of a project might have service contracts, or staff training and cleaning manuals, so that belongs in operations. For instance, the hair salon‚Äôs espresso machine in the kitchen area and massage chairs by the sinks.

## Overview

# 12.20 ‚ñ† Back office equipment & operations ‚õîÔ∏è

## Description

Anything that supports the business behind the scenes (staff only).

## Examples

If you run a beauty salon, your back office might be:
- a room out the back with a desk where you manage the business,
- and a small kitchen area for staff. 

If you‚Äôre a mobile personal trainer, your back office might be:
- your home office where you manage the business, 
- and shelves in your garage for your equipment. 

If you‚Äôre a freelance writer, your back office might be:
- your home office where you manage the business _and_ do your work. 

## Overview

By ‚Äòback office‚Äô we mean the part of your business premises that isn‚Äôt customer facing. It may be an actual office with paperclips and a desk. Or it could be some kind of area for staff to prepare meals, have a coffee, and relax on a break. 

It‚Äôs the beating heart of the business ‚Äì connecting the building to the outside world and looking after yourself/your staff during the work day. It‚Äôs also the equipment and operational stuff that will be common to many businesses. Whereas everyone‚Äôs ‚Äòfront office‚Äô, where you interact with customers, will differ. 

As always, there will be grey areas. When Lucy was a freelancer writer, as per the example above, all she had was a back office. She did not see customers at her business premises. But if she had another (fancier) room to hold meetings in, that would have been her front office. Some businesses might be 100% front office. It all depends. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

# Why did you separate back office and front office?

We decided to separate back office and front office because, depending on the business, these areas might have quite different suppliers, equipment, and daily operations. And different people might manage each area (you don‚Äôt want people trying to open the same spreadsheet at the same time).

# A restaurant in Chicago

When we were thinking about this, we often referred to the TV show, The Bear. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, it‚Äôs about a restaurant in Chicago.

The back office is run by Natalie. She‚Äôs in a room with a desk and a computer, sorting out all their administrative chaos. The front office is run by Richie. He‚Äôs in charge of the restaurant area where the customers are and the delivery of the product. The ‚Äòproduct‚Äô is run by Carmy. He‚Äôs in charge of the kitchen where the food is made, i.e. the product that they sell.

Some businesses are simpler than this, some might be more complicated. But hopefully this conveys the basic idea of ‚Äòstaff only‚Äô versus ‚Äòcustomer facing‚Äô areas.

# 12.21 Keep the lights on

## Description

Basic utility connections and services.

## Examples

Utility connections and bills (electricity, gas, water, telephone, internet); troubleshooting instructions; staff mobile phone contracts; parking bills; HVAC services.

## Overview

This is the foundation of your back office. Keeping the lights on and the phones ringing. All the account paperwork and bills go here, neatly sorted by year-month. And if you have more than one back office, use per-site subfolders and keep things consistent.

These utilities and services might be specific to the back office, or they might also support the front office. It doesn‚Äôt matter if there‚Äôs some overlap, as long as you know where things are. 

For example, a cafe might have one electricity connection that supplies all areas. Or a co-working space might have one wifi connection for back office staff and front office tenants. In both cases, they prefer to store their bills and other paperwork in back office. (Hint: if this applies to you, just leave a note in your JDex saying what‚Äôs where.)

This would also be a good place to put troubleshooting tips related to a service. For instance, under ‚Äòwater‚Äô save instructions for how to turn the water main off. Under ‚Äòelectricity‚Äô save a diagram of the fuse box layout and what to do in a blackout or power surge. Under ‚Äòinternet‚Äô save instructions for how to reset the wifi router.

## Overview

A place for anything to do with ensuring your back office building is safe and secure, and what to do if there‚Äôs an emergency. 

As well as bills and paperwork for equipment and services, this would be a good place to put processes for things like:
- ordering keys and access passes, 
- entering/leaving the building, 
- rebooting the security system, 
- backing up surveillance camera footage, 
- what important documents go in the safe (and who has the code).

This isn't for staff occupational health and safety, but there may be some overlap with training and other compliance obligations.

# 12.23 Keep it nice for us

## Description

Cleaning, gardening, decor, and waste removal.

## Examples

Cleaners; paid or municipal garbage collection; paper shredding and recycling; indoor plant watering; outdoor gardening; window washing; non-structural decorations like framed prints or plastic plants; anything to do with buying general cleaning and hygiene supplies (like kitchen roll, dishwashing liquid, tea towels, sponges, sprays, hand sanitiser, soap dispensers, toilet paper).

## Overview

Whether it‚Äôs just you in a home office, or a team of staff in a warehouse, keeping your work area clean and tidy can make a big difference to a long day. 

You might have contracts with suppliers for ongoing services, or you might do everything yourself. Or maybe you‚Äôre the person who secretly makes those signs with cartoon dogs that say ‚Äúplease unload the dishwasher‚Äù. Either way, track it all here.

## Exceptions

This is not for repairs and maintenance, that‚Äôs in [[12.15]].

# 12.24 Keep the back office well equipped

## Description

Office equipment and stationery.

## Examples

Buying standard office furniture like desks, chairs, cupboards and drawers; ordering anything you‚Äôd consider stationery from pens and sticky notes to paper and toner; ongoing service contracts for specialised equipment (like a fancy photocopier).

## Overview

This is for any kind of equipment and supplies that you use to run the back office. Most likely, this will be classic ‚Äòoffice stuff‚Äô. However, if ‚Äòback office‚Äô means something very specific to your business, then include whatever is relevant for you.

## Exceptions

Furniture that is a permanent fixture built during a fit-out goes in [[12.14]].

If a third party controls and services any IT equipment, manage that here. If you control it, it goes in [[14.10]].

# Why is third-party-controlled IT equipment in operations?

We made a decision to separate third-party-controlled IT equipment versus things that you control. If a supplier is providing an ongoing service to you, managing that becomes part of daily operations. 

But if you buy computers, printers, or other IT gadgets outright and control them, store the records and product manuals with your other technology in [[14.10]].

# 12.26 Keep us posted

## Description

Shipping, postage, and couriers.

## Examples

Post office receipts and tracking numbers; courier accounts; ordering postage supplies like stamps, envelopes, parcel satchels, and packing materials; document exchange (DX) and other business postal services; specialised shipping or air services; dealing with customs and import/export regulations.

## Overview

If you send or receive it and it‚Äôs related to back (or front) office operations, manage it here. This is for the day-to-day postage needs that every business has ‚Äì buying envelopes, popping to the post office, or having a bike courier account.

Realistically this includes front office operations as well. It‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôd have different postal requirements for both parts of the business, but who knows. If you do, then there‚Äôs plenty of room in [[12.30]] for another ID.

## Exceptions

If shipping your product to customers is a major part of your business, that is managed in [[20-29]].

## Also see

# Why is product-related shipping not managed here?

This ID is for the daily sending and receiving that most of us do. But if shipping your product to customers is a major part of your business, that is a process that needs its own space in [[20-29]]. Whether you send large freight consignments from a warehouse or run an Etsy shop from home, you‚Äôll have all sorts of things to manage.

For example, a web design agency manages all of their sending here. It‚Äôs primarily business administration and they don‚Äôt ship physical products to customers. They do things like:
- post signed paperwork to their accountant and lawyer,
- courier brochure artwork proofs to their printer,
- and send the odd parcel.

Conversely, a handmade candle business manages things like sending a letter to their accountant here. And _all_ of their candle shipping in [[20-29]]. They do things like:
- buy pre-paid parcel satchels and packing materials in bulk,
- and print address labels and other collateral material that goes in the parcels.

And a handmade furniture business manages things like sending a letter to their lawyer here. And _all_ of their furniture shipping in [[20-29]]. They do things like:
- deal with domestic air and land freight companies,
- and organise international container shipping and export paperwork.

# 12.30 ‚ñ† Front office equipment & operations üõéÔ∏è

## Description

Anything that supports the delivery of your product or service (open for business).

## Examples

If you run a beauty salon, your front office is:
- your shopfront, customer reception area, and treatment rooms.

If you‚Äôre a personal trainer, your front office might be:
- a gym where you rent space, or
- a registered area in a park (and your equipment is part of front office operations).

If you‚Äôre a freelance writer, your front office might be:
- non-existent because you only meet clients at their office, or
- a co-working space that you meet clients in, or 
- the same as your back office, clients come to you for meetings (and the fancy coffee and snacks you offer are part of front office operations).

## Overview

By ‚Äòfront office‚Äô we mean the part of your business premises that is customer facing and supports the delivery of your product or service. But it is _not_ the thing you sell. Some industries call this ‚Äòfront of house‚Äô if that makes it easier to think about. 

It might be an actual office, a retail store, the front of a cafe or bar, or a public space. It‚Äôs wherever you interact with your customers and the equipment or services you use during these interactions. 

And while many businesses might have a similar back office setup, your front office will be tailored to you.

## Exceptions

# Examples of product versus front office operations

A baker‚Äôs pie is their product. The branded napkins for customers are a front office supply (and they‚Äôre not what staff get in the back office). 

A haircut is a hairdresser‚Äôs product. The coffee and biscuits for customers are front office supplies.

A clean dog is a dog groomer‚Äôs product. The hose used to wash it is a front office supply.

# Why did you separate back office and front office?

As mentioned in [[12.20]], we decided to separate back office and front office because, depending on the business, these areas might have quite different equipment, suppliers, and daily operations. And different people might manage each area (you don‚Äôt want people trying to open the same spreadsheet at the same time).

# A restaurant in Chicago

When we were thinking about this, we often referred to the TV show, The Bear. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, it‚Äôs about a restaurant in Chicago. 

The back office is run by Natalie. She‚Äôs in a room with a desk and a computer, sorting out all their administrative chaos. The front office is run by Richie. He‚Äôs in charge of the restaurant area where the customers are and the delivery of the product. The ‚Äòproduct‚Äô is run by Carmy. He‚Äôs in charge of the kitchen where the food is made, i.e. the product that they sell.

Some business are simpler than this, some might be more complicated. But hopefully this conveys the basic idea of ‚Äòstaff only‚Äô versus ‚Äòcustomer facing‚Äô areas.

# I don‚Äôt have a front office

If you do everything in your back office and never interact with customers, this section will be empty. That‚Äôs okay. Parts of this system will be very quiet for many businesses and super busy for others. 

For example, Johnny.Decimal HQ operates solely in a rented back office, with two staff, and no vehicles. Most of our business administration is money related, and even then, our accountant does the heavy lifting. When Lucy was a freelance writer, everything happened in her back office ‚Äì a desk with a laptop. Pretty simple.

# 12.31 Keep the lights on

## Description

Additional utility connections and services.

## Examples

Utility connections and bills (electricity, gas, water, telephone, internet); any other fees related to heating or cooling (like a generator or ice); troubleshooting instructions.

## Overview

This is a place for any basic utilities and services that are _only_ in the front office. This might be empty if your back office utilities cover both areas. But if not, keep the account paperwork and bills here, neatly sorted by year-month. 

And if you have more than one front office (maybe you have a couple of retail outlets), use per-site subfolders and keep things consistent.

This would also be a good place to put troubleshooting tips related to a service. For instance, under ‚Äòinternet‚Äô save instructions for how to reset the wifi router. Under ‚Äògas‚Äô save the preferred locations to swap gas bottles.

## Exceptions

## Also see

Mobile phone contracts and bills go here, but the management of the device itself lives in [[14.12]].

## Further reading

# Examples of front office versus back office utilities

A hair salon has:
- a wifi account for customer use (front office),
- and a separate internet connection in the back office for staff.

A cafe has:
- a food truck with gas bottles (front office), 
- but they don‚Äôt need gas in their back office. 

A coffee cart uses:
- a power outlet provided by the city (front office), 
- which is a separate account to their back office electricity. 

A mobile beer cart has:
- a generator to cool its kegs (front office), 
- but the brewery back office has a standard electricity connection.

A market stall uses:
- ice to keep its product cool on hot days (front office), 
- but they don‚Äôt use ice in their back office.

# 12.32 Keep our customers secure

## Description

Security, safety, and emergencies.

## Examples

Bills and paperwork for any paid security services; building access passes and codes; emergency and evacuation plans; bills for fire safety equipment; contact details for security services; instructions for how to turn the alarm on/off and entering/leaving the building; location of spare keys; surveillance camera installation; smoke or gas detector installation; who to call in different types of emergency (fire, flood, storm damage, robbery); Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS).

## Overview

This is a place for bills, paperwork, and anything else related to the security and safety of the front office. This might be empty if your back office setup covers both areas.

As per [[12.22]], this would be a good place to put processes. For instance, your restaurant‚Äôs front office with flames and sharp knives will have very different safety procedures and equipment to the back office where you sit at a desk doing accounts. 

And there might be a completely different way to access your front office (a computerised alarm system and automatic doors) versus the back office (a padlocked roller door in a loading dock). 

This is not for staff occupational health and safety, but there may be some overlap with training and other compliance obligations.

## Exceptions

This is not your business risk and emergency management plans, they‚Äôre in [[11.23]].

## Also see

If anything here helps you meet compliance obligations (e.g. installing exit signs and a sprinkler system), store the paperwork here and note it in [[11.13]].

## Examples

Free-standing furniture that isn‚Äôt part of a fit-out; branded items like napkins and paper shopping bags; electrical appliances; payment equipment like tills and handheld ‚Äòtap and go‚Äô units; general office supplies and stationery; ongoing service contracts for specialised equipment.

## Overview

This is for any kind of equipment and supplies that you use to run the front office and deliver your product or service to customers. What‚Äôs in this ID is going to vary widely for different businesses.

## Exceptions

Furniture that is a permanent fixture built during a fit-out goes in [[12.14]].

If a third party controls and services any IT equipment, manage that here. If you control it, it goes in [[14.10]].

# What do you mean by front office equipment?

We would classify a personal trainer‚Äôs exercise equipment, a gardener‚Äôs lawnmower, and a hairdresser‚Äôs scissors as front office equipment. These items _support_ the products they sell ‚Äì fitness, cut grass, and hair cuts, respectively.

A photographer‚Äôs screens, cameras, and lights are front office ‚Äì they support the delivery of their product, the photographs. 

A plumber‚Äôs tools and logo-bearing work shirt are front office ‚Äì they support the delivery of their product, the unblocked toilet. 

However, if the plumber replaces a broken part in a toilet with a spare from their van, then that would be classified under ‚Äòproduct‚Äô. They are on-selling the spare part, so that gets tracked in [[20-29]].

# Why is third-party-controlled IT equipment in operations?

We made a decision to separate third-party-controlled IT equipment versus things that you control. If a supplier is providing an ongoing service to you, managing that becomes part of daily operations.

Anything complimentary you provide for customers/clients like tea, coffee, biscuits, lollies, or filtered water; any equipment that you use to prepare complimentary food or beverages for customers.

## Overview

This is all about the nice touches you offer to your customers. A cup of herbal tea or a glass of Prosecco at a beauty salon. A coffee and a biscuit at a hair salon. A water cooler in the reception area of your dental surgery. The theme here is that food and beverage is not your core business, it‚Äôs a complimentary add-on.

## Exceptions

If food and/or beverage is the product you sell (e.g. in a cafe, bar, restaurant, retail shop, market stall, or anywhere else), that‚Äôs managed in [[20-29]].

## Description

## Overview

Whether they‚Äôre part of your back office or front office, the following section is a place to manage motor vehicles and anything else that moves.

## Exceptions

## Further reading

# Why did we classify vehicles as formal and informal?

Many businesses manage all kinds of vehicles that are part of their daily operations. But the more we thought about it, we weren‚Äôt sure that a one-size-fits-all approach was the right way. So in this section we‚Äôve suggested that vehicles be classified into two buckets ‚Äì ‚Äòformal‚Äô and ‚Äòinformal‚Äô. 

_Formal_ vehicles include anything that requires official registrations and inspections, whether it‚Äôs motorised or not. If it travels on a public road and requires insurance, or does anything serious like carrying passengers or dangerous goods, then manage it in:
- [[12.41]], 
- [[12.42]], 
- [[12.43]], 
- [[12.44]], and 
- [[12.45]].

_Informal_ vehicles do not fit the above description. Manage those, as well as any public or shared transportation that your business uses, in [[12.46]].

As always, if you can‚Äôt decide what goes where, don‚Äôt stress. Just make a decision and note what you did in your JDex. And if you want to discuss our classification, head over to the [[community]].

# 12.41 Official documents (formal)

## Description

The important documents associated with owning, leasing, or selling a vehicle.

## Examples

Proof of ownership; government registrations and taxes; financing, leases, and hire-purchase agreements; log books.

## Overview

This is a place to manage anything to do with ‚Äòformal‚Äô vehicles ‚Äì those that require official paperwork like registrations, inspections, or mandatory insurance. For many businesses this will be cars, vans, and trucks. But it could be anything, motorised or not, depending on what you do and where you trade.

If you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or registration. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.

This can also include the future, so store your new vehicle searches here too.

## Exceptions

This does not include renting a car as part of a business trip. Store that with the trip down in [[15.XX]].

# What do you mean by formal vehicle?

When we say ‚Äòformal vehicle‚Äô, ‚Äòmotor vehicle‚Äô, or ‚Äòregistered vehicle‚Äô, it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a car, trailer, boat, seaplane, caravan, hot-air balloon, or Hansom cab. If it‚Äôs core to your business and requires some kind of official paperwork, put it up here. 

# What are some other formal vehicles?

This isn‚Äôt limited to cars, vans, and trucks. 

A farm might have motorbikes, tractors, and a harvester. A fishing business will have boats. A flight training school will have a plane or a helicopter. A tree surgeon will have a cherry picker. We know someone whose agricultural business uses drones that must be registered with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. 

Then there‚Äôs things that can be towed and require a registration to travel on roads. Such as trailers used by gardeners, and converted caravans for food or coffee service. 

And of course there‚Äôll be grey areas. Maybe you have a hot air balloon business. Not a traditional motor vehicle, but they need to be certified and transported on a registered trailer. So they go here. 

What if you have an unregistered tractor that never leaves your farm? You‚Äôll have proof of ownership documents and you might register it _someday_. So it goes here.

Here‚Äôs another niche, but relevant, example. What if you run a Hansom cab (horse and carriage) business? The carriage isn‚Äôt a traditional motor vehicle. But it carries passengers, often in busy cities. You‚Äôll no doubt have registrations, inspections, and other paperwork for this vehicle. So it goes here. And your horses fit nicely in [[11.45]].

# 12.42 Vehicle insurance, incidents, & claims (formal)

## Description

Policies, coverage details, incident reports, and claim forms for your vehicles.

## Examples

Comprehensive car or motorcycle insurance; third party car or motorcycle insurance; caravan insurance; trailer insurance; boat insurance; any other form of commercial vehicle insurance.

## Overview

Again, when we say ‚Äòvehicle‚Äô this will mean different things to different businesses. But we needed a catch-all label here. It could be a car, boat, or rickshaw. But if it‚Äôs covered under a vehicle insurance policy, put it here. In contrast, a bicycle or e-scooter, might be covered as a mobile item under your office/home contents policy.

Insurance companies often have commercial policies that are designed for business owners. So it might pay to look around to see what‚Äôs right for you. And note that some insurances may be required by law. For instance, in Australia third party personal injury insurance is compulsory for business vehicles.

If you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or registration. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.

This is also a place to save incident reports that might become part of a claim. For example, something is stolen and you file a police report.

## Exceptions

## Also see

Having an up-to-date inventory at [[12.XX]] will be helpful if you need to make a claim. 

## Further reading

# What if I store equipment in a vehicle _and_ a fixed location?

As noted at [[12.12]], if you store equipment in both a vehicle and a fixed location, there might be some overlap here. Just do what makes sense to you. For instance, if you‚Äôre a plumber your equipment might be insured in your home garage and also in your van. If these are separate policies then save them where relevant and leave a note in your JDex.

# Why is vehicle insurance here?

As mentioned previously, we recommend that insurance details should live next to the thing that is being insured. This will help your brain find things, and ensure other relevant information is nearby if you‚Äôre dealing with a claim or policy renewal.

# 12.43 Permits, tolls, fees, & other running expenses (formal)

## Description

Anything that says you have permission to go through, or stay in, a certain area, plus daily vehicle running expenses.

## Examples

Permits for parking, deliveries, or general entry; e-tag accounts and toll road passes; fees or exemptions for congestion charge zones; short-term parking fees; daily running expenses such as fuel, EV charging, oil, wiper fluid, and cleaning.

## Overview

These examples are car focused for simplicity. But if you have different types of vehicles, adapt as needed. For instance, you might have to pay marina or airport fees for a boat or plane that are equivalent to car parking.

Running expenses are the everyday transactions related to your vehicles like buying fuel or going to the car wash. Contrast with repairs and maintenance, which are less frequent transactions and are managed separately below.

Depending on your business, this might be a busy ID if you have a lot of running expenses. But as long as you process the receipts in your inbox regularly and archive them neatly, you‚Äôll stay on top of what you‚Äôre spending.

If you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or registration. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.

## Exceptions

Repairs, maintenance, and associated purchases go in [[12.45]].

# 12.44 Fit-outs, renovations, & improvements (formal)

## Description

A place for larger projects that aren‚Äôt general upkeep.

## Examples

Fitting-out a caravan for food service with flooring, cabinetry, utility connections, and a service hatch; renovating a dog grooming van by replacing the sinks, hoses, and taps, and re-waterproofing the interior; installing custom-made, fixed tool boxes in the back of a tradesperson‚Äôs ute/truck; mood boards, measurements, and a budget spreadsheet for reupholstering a boat; research, designs, and quotes for a full van signage wrap.

## Overview

This is a place to manage larger projects, specific to vehicles, that have an end. And once done, you move into front or back office operations mode. As such, we recommend that any equipment ordered as part of the project be stored in [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].

If you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or registration. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.

## Exceptions

Front or back office equipment ordered as part of a project goes in [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].

# Why did you separate equipment from the overall building project?

Similar to [[12.14]], we made a decision that these type of projects are about building and installing things that are designed for a specific vehicle ‚Äì and they‚Äôre unlikely to have an ops manual. For instance, a built-in bench in a food truck.

Whereas front or back office _equipment_ ordered as part of a project might have service contracts, or staff training and cleaning manuals, so that belongs in operations. For instance, a coffee cart‚Äôs espresso machine or till.

# 12.45 Repairs & maintenance (formal)

## Description

A place for fixing things and taking care of your vehicles.

## Examples

Quotes from mechanics and other tradespeople; research on how to repair things; annual service appointments and logs; less frequent running expenses such as new tyres and other spare parts; maintenance manuals, instructions, and checklists.

## Overview

When something that‚Äôs part of a vehicle breaks, or you‚Äôre trying to prevent it from breaking, manage it here. 

This is for daily repairs and maintenance specific to the vehicle, not any equipment in or on it. For instance, if your ice cream van‚Äôs radiator bursts, record the repair details here. But the soft serve machine‚Äôs maintenance goes in [[12.34]].

If you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or registration. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.

## Exceptions

Repairing and maintaining equipment that‚Äôs in/on the vehicle is part of [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].

This is not for daily running expenses, put those in [[12.43]].

## Also see

## Further reading

# Why did you include less frequent running expenses here?

We made a decision to include less frequent purchases up here, such as tyres and spare parts. They‚Äôre still running expenses, but you only buy them sporadically. And they tend to be linked directly to a repair or discovered during routine maintenance. 

Here they won‚Äôt be lost among receipts for daily running expenses like fuel and other consumables. And they‚Äôll be close to maintenance and service records, which may be relevant for warranties or future re-sale value.

# 12.46 Public or shared transport & other ‚Äòinformal‚Äô vehicles

## Description

All the other ways to get around, either shared with the public or that you own and maintain.

## Examples

Public transport like buses, trains, light rail, taxis, or ferries; ride sharing services; accounts to use share cars, e-scooters, or e-bikes; any other type of informal vehicle that you own. 

## Overview

This is a place to manage anything to do with using public or shared transport, or owning informal vehicles. 

By ‚Äòinformal‚Äô we mean the vehicle probably doesn‚Äôt need official paperwork like registrations, inspections, or mandatory insurance. Who knows what other kinds of vehicle are part of your business. If it can be pedalled, stood on, sat on, or pulled along, put it here. 

These type of vehicles may or may not have their own insurance. They might be covered under a policy for your home office or other fixed-location premises. If not, store the details here and note it in your JDex.

If you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or unique identifier. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.

# 12.50 ‚ñ† The community üß©

## Description

You‚Äôre part of something bigger ‚Äì interactions with the neighbourhood, the region, the planet.

## Examples

## Overview

Your business is part of a wider community ‚Äì schools, hospitals, clubs, local government and media, the environment, etc. And sometimes it will interact with the community in different ways. 

This section isn‚Äôt about your core business, your employees, suppliers, or professional bodies. It‚Äôs a place for civics, community engagement, and being a good business citizen. It‚Äôs giving versus getting.

This is a broad umbrella and may not be that relevant for many businesses. But if this sounds like you, then put any relevant contact details, notes, and other documents here.

## Exceptions

## Further reading

# Why did you include this section?

After seeing some folder structures from other business owners, we realised that civics and community engagement can be a big deal. So we wanted to make sure there was a place for this stuff to keep it separate from daily operations. Especially if you participate in recurring events, you‚Äôll want to easily find and reuse certain items each time.

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place for anything to do with relationships that you maintain that are close by ‚Äì your direct neighbours or surrounding streets. You‚Äôre probably on a first-name basis and know each other reasonably well.

Maybe you store the contact details, opening hours, or annual holidays, of other businesses in your shopping centre in case of emergency. Or you might have reminders to bring in mail or garbage bins for your neighbours sometimes. 

Perhaps you offer discounts to certain neighbourhood businesses and you keep a list of what these are. Or maybe you‚Äôre part of a ‚Äòneighbourhood watch‚Äô-style group where everyone keeps an eye on things. Either way, store any notes or documents here.

Maybe you have interactions with your local chamber of commerce. Or perhaps your business donates its product or services to an annual charity event, parade, or community group.

# 12.90 ‚ñ† Where I trade & how I get around library üìö

## Description

A place to put information that‚Äôs related to this category, kinda interesting, mostly unimportant, and definitely doesn‚Äôt fit elsewhere.

## Examples

## Overview

Caution. This is a place for when there is no other place. Don‚Äôt get lazy and dump stuff here that is important and/or has a home elsewhere in the system.

This might be information that you found interesting or might be useful someday. But right now, it‚Äôs not strongly related to any other ID. And it would not make sense to clutter an existing ID or create a new one for it.

It‚Äôs a library so we want to keep it neat. Label any files with clear descriptions and use the year-month method in case the information is time sensitive.

## Exceptions
## Also see

## Further reading

# Why did you include a library in each category?

We wanted to be realistic and acknowledge that sometimes there is miscellanea that accumulates over time. It could be anything ‚Äì a document, photo, URL, email, note, or a physical item. But it‚Äôs not the _work_ that you do. It‚Äôs things that you‚Äôve found online or in real life, or perhaps that you‚Äôve created. 

It doesn‚Äôt fit anywhere else. It‚Äôs just a thing you wanted to save. And you don‚Äôt want it muddying other folders where work happens. Importantly, it‚Äôs not that important. It has nothing to do with business operations. If it wasn‚Äôt backed up it wouldn‚Äôt matter. If you lose it, you could probably download it again.

# Why are there no IDs here?

It‚Äôs difficult to imagine how these libraries might be used. So we didn‚Äôt want to commit to IDs yet. By leaving these sections blank, we can introduce everyone to the careful consideration that goes into making a new ID. 

If you‚Äôre ready to save things in this library, come over to the [[community]] and see what others are doing. Or ask us for advice. We‚Äôll figure it out together and eventually settle on some standard IDs. In the meantime, just keep things neat and tidy here.

# Leave yourself JDex notes

Remember to leave a note in your JDex when you save things in this library so you can find them easily. This is an important habit to get into, by the way. Don‚Äôt agonise if you‚Äôre unsure where something should go. Find the first relevant ID, make a decision, and leave yourself a note. Having a well-maintained JDex means you‚Äôll never lose anything again.

13 üí∞ Money earned, spent, saved, & owed

## Description

This category is all about keeping track of your finances, from planning and budgeting, to reconciling and submitting your annual returns.

## Examples

## Overview

First and foremost, remember that we‚Äôre not accountants, bookkeepers, or financial advisers. We want to help small businesses be more organised and avoid surprises at tax time. So we made a simple framework to manage finances in. Even if you use accounting software, you still need places to store things and do certain processing tasks.

Our goal is to give you:
- logical buckets to put things in,
- processes to get your data in shape for your accountant,
- advice on saving your records neatly.

There are some accounting terms here. But we didn‚Äôt get too technical. If an accountant looked here, we hope they‚Äôd be able to find what they need. Although they might structure and name things differently.

## Exceptions

This category is for managing _your_ finances ‚Äì if your product or service is related (e.g. you‚Äôre an accountant, bookkeeper, or financial adviser) that goes in [[20-29]].

## Also see

## Further reading

# This category will be busier for some than others

If you‚Äôre a sole trader, you might just be tracking basic incomings and outgoings. Compared with someone who manages things like payroll, investments, or company equity. Although, the more complex your affairs, the more we‚Äôre assuming you have software and/or a professional to handle a lot of the money stuff for you.

# Copying is okay, sometimes

Note that you might end up copying important static* records like receipts and invoices to or from this category. For example, you file the original expense receipt for a computer in [[13.33]], and also add a copy to [[14.11]] so it‚Äôs with the warranty. Or you add a copy of the title deed for your office premises to [[13.44]], but the original lives in [[12.11]]. This is okay. It‚Äôs part of being able to see the whole picture. 

*By ‚Äòstatic‚Äô we mean things that were sent to you that can‚Äôt be changed (e.g. a PDF). As compared to internal files that you work on (e.g. a spreadsheet). You should never have multiple copies of the latter. You‚Äôll end up working on the wrong version and being very sad when you realise. This is not the Decimal way.

# Use of the word ‚Äòaccount‚Äô in this category

## An account could be many things

For simplicity, when we say account we‚Äôre referring to any account or service that manages money in some way. This includes traditional cash, credit card, loan, or investment accounts. But also online platforms, apps, and any other modern service. For instance, PayPal, Stripe, ‚Äòbuy now, pay later‚Äô providers, money-transfer services, or even digital currency exchanges and wallets.

## Different accounts for different tasks

While many businesses will have one cash account to handle all incomings and outgoings (i.e. a standard business bank account), we wanted to leave room for those who do things differently. For instance, you might have completely (or mostly) separate accounts for income and expenses. If so, you may prefer to keep them in either [[13.22]] or [[13.32]]. 

Here‚Äôs some scenarios. 

**A cooking school has online courses on a learning platform:**
- Customer transactions are handled by Stripe. 
- This account is one-way only. It collects and holds income, and transfers it to a standard business bank account each month.
- The owners keep account paperwork from Stripe in [[13.22]]. 
- And their standard business bank account records are in [[13.42]].

**A veterinary surgery accepts payments via Afterpay:** 
- The Afterpay retail account is linked to a standard business bank account.
- The owners keep account paperwork from Afterpay in [[13.22]].
- And their standard business bank account records are in [[13.42]].

**A chicken rescue charity keeps separate bank accounts for income and expenses:**
- All donations are collected in one bank account, which is managed in [[13.22]].
- All expenses are paid from a different bank account, which is managed in [[13.32]].
- They also have a standard business bank account for other miscellanea, which is managed in [[13.42]].

Who knows what other variations occur in real life. An eBay store with an income-only PayPal account. Or a business that prefers to pay for all their expenses with Bitcoin. If this sounds like you, then [[13.22]] and [[13.32]] might be useful. 

Otherwise, just manage your standard business bank account in [[13.42]].

# 13.11 Financial planning

## Description

Calculations, budgets, goals, and strategies to help you know where you stand.

## Examples

## Overview

Whether you‚Äôve received professional financial advice or you‚Äôre figuring things out yourself, this is a place to do the work. This ID will probably end up full of notes, calculations, or spreadsheets. Whatever you do here, we recommend subfolder-ing by tax year to keep it neat and relevant to each accounting period.

# What is the goal of this ID?

We reckon it‚Äôs worthwhile to look under every rock and not be afraid of what you might find. Especially when you‚Äôre starting out and need to ensure your business is financially viable. If it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs a hobby. And that‚Äôs not why we‚Äôre here.

For instance, how many customers does a burger truck need every hour to be profitable? When we see local businesses failing, we often worry that too many people aren‚Äôt working this out truthfully before they fully commit to an idea.

If you know what you need to spend each month to meet obligations and then make a profit, you know what you need to earn. Even if you‚Äôre a not-for-profit, you‚Äôve still got obligations.

After some initial busywork and tedium, you‚Äôll hopefully feel more informed, calm, and in control. Which is the goal of this ID.

# Questions you might ask yourself here

Financial planning is a broad term. If you‚Äôre not sure what you might research and plan in this ID, here‚Äôs some questions to get started:

- Is my business idea viable?,
- What are my start-up and ongoing operating budgets?,
- What taxes apply to me? (e.g. income, sales, fringe benefits, capital gains, payroll, land, stamp duty),
- What are my financial goals and some strategies to reach them?,
- Will I use digital tools and accounting, time-tracking, or payroll software?,
- Will I rely on a bookkeeper or accountant or do as much as I can myself?,
- What kind of bank account/s do I need?,
- How will I deal with cash? (e.g. currency conversions, cash floats, petty cash, cash books),
- Do I need help protecting profits? (e.g. diversifying investments to reduce risk).

# Even a little planning helps

You might be fancy and have software doing all sorts of analyses for you. But a lot of us with simple businesses can rest easier with even a little due diligence.

For instance, as a sole trader for many years Lucy didn‚Äôt do that much financial planning. But she always had an up-to-date spreadsheet covering things like:
- expected business and living expenses, 
- mandatory tax obligations like sales and income taxes, 
- voluntary pension contributions,
- income thresholds that would affect the entity*,
- and other more aspirational buckets for savings and fun stuff.

Most important for Lucy was maintaining a cashflow ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô so she could operate while waiting for people to pay her. Hers covered about 6 months worth of living expenses.

Everyone‚Äôs safety net will be different. But Lucy learned quickly that having no safety net is stressful because nobody pays your invoice on the day you send it. And the bigger the company, the slower the payroll department. So that might be another thing to consider here.

*Such as [‚Äòthe 80/20 PSI rule‚Äô](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/personal-services-income/working-out-if-the-psi-rules-apply/self-assessing-as-a-psb) and [GST threshold](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/gst-excise-and-indirect-taxes/gst/registering-for-gst?initialSessionID=356-9798696-9300260&ld=SDAUSOADirect#GSTTurnover) in Australia.

# 13.14 Financial catch-all

## Description

## Examples

Documents related to your credit rating and history.

## Overview

Ideally you should be able to find a place for random things below. But it‚Äôs not uncommon to get financial documents that are one-offs or don‚Äôt fit elsewhere. We don‚Äôt know what kind of miscellaneous paperwork is issued to businesses around the world. So we wanted to leave space just in case.

Remember to leave a note in your JDex when you save things in this ID so you can find them easily. 

This is an important habit to get into, by the way. Don‚Äôt agonise if you‚Äôre unsure where something should go. Find the first relevant ID, make a decision, and leave yourself a note. Having a well-maintained JDex means you‚Äôll never lose anything again.

## Examples

## Overview

Think of this ID like a garden shed. It's where you can do rough work without anyone having to see it.

It contains an inbox where income records are held until you process and permanently file them in either:
- [[13.23]],
- [[13.24]],
- [[13.25]],
- [[13.26]]. 

And if you need to do any messy calculations as you process the income, there‚Äôs room here. 

## Exceptions

## Further reading

# Why did you create inboxes?

The goal of the five ‚Äòinbox and processing‚Äô IDs in this category is to add a little rigour to ensure you don‚Äôt miss anything. Income payments and tax deductible expenses are like treasure. And forgetting to pay other people is bad form. 

We don‚Äôt want to accidentally overlook these things because we‚Äôre busy keeping our customers happy. So hopefully these ops manuals will help form good habits around cross-checking incomings and outgoings.

And if you need space to be messy and do some calculations, then we wanted to make room for that too. For instance, every month Johnny has to download inscrutable income data from Stripe and fuss with it until it‚Äôs in a format our accountant can use. This is where he would do that work.

# What if I use software?

If you use point-of-sale and/or accounting software then a lot of work will be automated. However, it‚Äôs still important to cross-check that everything is as it should be and the income is in your bank account.

# 13.22 Accounts that deliver income

## Description

The formal statements and paperwork for accounts or platforms that are primarily used to receive income.

## Examples

Standard bank accounts; online payment processors like Stripe, PayPal, or Payoneer; merchant accounts for ‚Äòbuy now, pay later‚Äô services like Afterpay or Klarna; digital wallet services like WeChat Pay or Grab; money-transfer services like Western Union; creator support platforms like Patreon; crowdfunding services like Kickstarter.

## Overview

This is a place for any accounts whose primary function is _delivering_ money to you. 

This might sound strange, but it‚Äôs increasingly common for many businesses. For instance, the accounts that online payment processors or sales channels deliver earnings through. Or maybe you have a bank account that is only for deposits. Store those formal statements here too.

We recommend using the year-month method when saving paperwork and statements so everything sorts neatly. And subfolder by account issuer.

## Exceptions

If you just use a standard bank account for both incomings and outgoings, that goes in [[13.42]].

## Also see

## Further reading

# Why did you leave space for income-only accounts?

Many businesses won‚Äôt need this ID if they just use a regular bank account for income and expenses. But we wanted to leave space for other types of ‚Äòone-way‚Äô accounts that bring money in because they‚Äôre becoming more common. 

Whether you sell things online or in person, these services process payments, collect earnings, and then transfer them to your designated bank account. They are important because they handle income. If you get audited and forget to mention them, the tax man might have something to say about that.

As per the Johnny.Decimal rule, if it logically fits higher up in the system, put it in the first place that makes sense. So that‚Äôs why we recommend differentiating these accounts and storing their paperwork and statements up here.

# An example of an income-only account

At JDHQ, we have online courses on a learning platform. They process payments via Stripe. We want to track this account because it contains data that we need to calculate income. And depending on where a customer lives, we may need to pay sales tax on the transaction. 

This account is _only_ incomings, we can‚Äôt pay expenses with it. It holds money until they release it to a nominated bank account. Therefore, we would store the formal Stripe account statements here. 

# What do you mean by ‚Äòformal‚Äô statements and paperwork?

Static documents supplied by a platform or bank (e.g. PDFs). As opposed to raw data that you might download into a spreadsheet and manipulate. Do that kind of work in [[13.21]]. 

### A note on crowdfunding

fyi, your accountant might pull a face at our classification of crowdfunding as income. They probably prefer terms such as ‚Äòdeferred or unearned revenue‚Äô and think it should live down in [[13.50]]. 

Let them pull their face and then do what they need to do on the balance sheet. As we‚Äôve said, we‚Äôre not accountants, we‚Äôre here to help you find stuff. And we think many people would think of crowdfunding as income and look for it here.

Whether you send out invoices for your work*, download reports from a till or online platform, or tally up a cash book, these are your sales. This includes long-term income for things like royalties and book sales. You did the work once and continue to get paid for it.

The goal of the five ‚Äòinbox and processing‚Äô IDs in this category is to add a little rigour to ensure you don‚Äôt miss anything. Income payments and tax deductible expenses are like treasure. And forgetting to pay other people is bad form. 

We don‚Äôt want to accidentally overlook these things because we‚Äôre busy keeping our customers happy. So hopefully these ops manuals will help form good habits around cross-checking incomings and outgoings.

# 13.32 Accounts that handle expenses

## Description

The formal statements and paperwork for accounts or platforms that are primarily used to pay expenses.

## Examples

Online payment processors like PayPal or Payoneer; ‚Äòbuy now, pay later‚Äô services like Afterpay or Klarna; digital wallet services like WeChat Pay or Grab; money-transfer services like Western Union; a standard bank account.

## Overview

This is a place for any accounts whose primary function is _spending_ money. 

As per the note in [[13.22]], ignore this ID if it‚Äôs not relevant to you. We don‚Äôt have an account like this, but we wanted to leave room for those that do.

Perhaps you use a service like Payoneer to handle payments to international suppliers. Or maybe you buy things via a platform like Afterpay*. Manage your relationship with those organisations here. Or maybe you have a bank account that is only for outgoings. Store those formal statements here too.

We recommend using the year-month method when saving paperwork and statements so everything sorts neatly. And subfolder by account issuer.

*Note that if you become an Afterpay merchant one day, you could 'promote' it up to [[13.22]]). 

## Exceptions

If you just use a standard bank account for both incomings and outgoings, that goes in [[13.42]].

# Why did you leave space for expense-only accounts?

Many businesses won‚Äôt need this ID if they just use a regular bank account to handle income and expenses. But we wanted to leave space for other types of ‚Äòone-way‚Äô accounts that send money out. You don‚Äôt want to miss anything in case it‚Äôs deductible.

# What do you mean by ‚Äòformal‚Äô statements and paperwork?

Static documents supplied by a platform or bank (e.g. PDFs). As opposed to raw data that you might download into a spreadsheet and manipulate. Do that kind of work in [[13.31]].

# 13.33 Receipts

## Description

The place to file processed receipts.

## Examples

## Overview

We‚Äôve classified an ‚Äòexpense‚Äô as something that you have already paid for either on the spot (i.e. with a card), or via an automatic payment (i.e. a direct debit).

As per the ops manual, once you‚Äôve processed expenses in [[13.31]], permanently file any receipts here. 

We recommend using the year-month method when saving this kind of paperwork so everything sorts neatly. And subfolder by expense category.

## Exceptions

These are not bills that you set aside time to pay manually, manage those in [[13.50]].

## Also see

## Further reading

# Is the receipt important?

There‚Äôll probably be lots of receipts that you don‚Äôt consider to be that important. Such as everyday consumables like petrol or milk for the office fridge. Just keep them all here for however long you‚Äôre required to by law.

But for ‚Äòimportant‚Äô receipts for higher-value items and/or anything with a warranty, you might like to add a copy to where the thing lives in the system. For instance, you buy a new laptop. The receipt sits in the expenses inbox until you process it. You then permanently file it here and also add a copy to [[14.11]].

# Classifying automated bill payments as expenses

Normally we think of the bills that we receive by email or post as liabilities. But as noted in [[13.54]], we made a decision to classify _direct debits_ of bill payments as going ‚Äòstraight to expenses‚Äô. They‚Äôre paid automatically and you don‚Äôt need to plan a time to physically transfer money. 

For instance, you‚Äôve set up direct debits for your utility bills. They‚Äôre paid automatically on the due date. Now they‚Äôre just expense transactions on your bank statement that you process and file here.

# 13.34 Payroll

## Description

The place to manage anything to do with wages, leave, pensions, health insurance, and other benefits.

## Examples

## Overview

Payroll is serious stuff. Depending on where you are in the world, there are strict governance and compliance obligations to meet. And harsh penalties if you don‚Äôt. No matter how nice your business is, realistically, your staff are here for the money. So payroll must go seamlessly every single cycle.

Therefore, we can‚Äôt advise you how to do it.* It‚Äôs beyond our scope. We recommend outsourcing the process to an accountant or bookkeeper who specialises in payroll, and/or using payroll software. But we _do_ think that payroll lives over here with the money and numbers. It‚Äôs just an expense.

*Perhaps one day, after community discussion with experienced business owners and accountants/bookkeepers, we can develop an ops manual that covers payroll basics.

## Exceptions

If you receive bills for payroll tax, process them in [[13.51]] and file the records in [[13.62]].

## Also see

Store copies of final payroll records with the individual in [[11.42]] ‚Äì this is not only good practice, but likely a legal requirement.

## Further reading

# What kinds of things might go here?

If you have staff, the kinds of things you might manage here include:
- timekeeping (e.g. rosters, records of attendance, overtime, project timesheets),
- wages, payslips, and remittance,
- income tax withholding,
- pension payments,
- health insurance,
- paid or unpaid leave of any kind,
- allowances (e.g. for meals, clothing, training),
- any benefits, bonuses, rewards, or incentives in salary packages,
- expense reimbursement.

# 13.35 Subscriptions, memberships, & other recurring expenses

## Description

A master list of everything you‚Äôve signed up for so you can keep track of it.

## Examples

Software; apps; web services like hosting and domains; cloud storage; media and streaming services; food, beverage, or other office supply subscriptions; carshare or other transport subscriptions; staff memberships for gyms and clubs; recurring charity donations; crowdfunding or financial support platforms; memberships for things like online communities and newsletters; payment agreements for professional services like your accountant; plus any sort of automatic payments (i.e. direct debits) for recurring expenses.

## Overview

It‚Äôs easy to lose track of automatic payments. Especially those that renew annually. So this is a place to list them all in a JDex note, spreadsheet, or however you prefer. 

This ID is not for occasional scheduled payments that you do yourself (i.e. you schedule a bill payment 3 days from now). It‚Äôs for services where you have given someone permission to take money on a recurring basis, and it might be the only way they receive payment. 

Seeing it all in one place can help you know what outgoings to expect each week, month, or year. And if you want to pause or cancel anything, you‚Äôre not searching all over the place to remember what you‚Äôve got.

## Exceptions

This is not the place to keep formal paperwork related to these services. Store that in the relevant place in the system, for example:
- a back office water cooler subscription lives in [[12.25]],
- a carshare subscription lives in [[12.46]].
- a digital music subscription lives in [[14.32]].

## Further reading

# Why did you create this ID?

This ID came about from a desire to not be surprised by annual payments for software and other online services. You might forget about them because you no longer need them. And depending on the company, they may not be interested in your sob story if you ask for a refund. 

But it‚Äôs also nice for cash flow purposes to know exactly how much money is going to get sucked out of your bank accounts. So we wanted to leave a place to collect everything like this in a list.

# 13.42 Accounts that handle cash

## Description

The formal statements and paperwork for accounts or platforms that are used for both incomings and outgoings.

## Examples

## Overview

This is the place to store all formal paperwork and statements for accounts that are used to both receive income and pay expenses.

For most small businesses this will be a traditional bank account ‚Äì probably your main account. But it might also include other types of specialised account, platform, or app. And if you‚Äôre a cyborg from the future and only deal with digital currency, then store those records here too.

We recommend using the year-month method when saving paperwork and statements so everything sorts neatly. And subfolder by account issuer.

# Do I need a business bank account?

In Australia, companies, partnerships, and trusts must have a business account for tax purposes. Sole traders can use a personal account, but a business account is still recommended. So if you‚Äôre just starting out, find out what‚Äôs required in your country and the kind of account that‚Äôs right for you.

# 13.43 Investments

## Description

Anything you class as an investment that you hope to receive returns from, or whose value you hope will appreciate.

## Examples

Shares; managed funds; bonds; term deposits; property that is not the business premises; high-value items like art or jewellery; trusts; director‚Äôs loans (aka Division 7A in Australia); digital currency; micro-investment apps.

## Overview

This is a place to store proof of ownership documents for any investments the business may have.

For instance:
- a certificate confirming you own shares, 
- a letter that confirms the conditions for a cash term deposit,
- a letter that confirms the number of units owned in a managed fund,
- a title deed for a rental property,
- a certificate of authenticity for that Caravaggio painting in the boardroom. 

These are probably longer term investments. If they‚Äôre short term, your accountant might want to classify them as current assets, but that‚Äôs up to them.

Also, if you have any share trading accounts, this _might_ be a place to store any paperwork for them. Otherwise consider [[13.22]]. In Australia, this could include things like Computershare.

## Exceptions

This is not for statements of earnings ‚Äì after processing the income, file those in [[13.24]].

## Also see

If you intend to sell all or part of an investment, remember to consider any tax implications such as capital gains in your budget and/or master finance record in [[13.11]].

# Property as an investment

To reiterate, we‚Äôre not accountants. And when we discussed property ownership, the conversation kept going around in circles. 

If you own your business premises that‚Äôs a fixed asset. But a lot of us would think, ‚Äúhey, isn‚Äôt that also an investment?‚Äù. And vice versa, if the business owns a rental property as an investment, that‚Äôs still a fixed asset right?

We‚Äôre not going to get involved in international balance sheet science. But we _can_ make a decision about folders.

Our recommendation is:
- If you own your business premises, the title deed lives in [[12.11]] and because it‚Äôs a fixed asset, copy it to [[13.44]]. 
- And if the business also owns a rental property that is _not_ where you trade, we consider that an investment. The rent is your earnings. So the title deed lives here. You could also copy it to [[13.44]] if you prefer.

If this sounds like madness, we can discuss it in the [[community]].

# 13.44 Fixed assets

## Description

Things owned for a longer term that help you run the business, like equipment, vehicles, and property.

## Examples

Land; buildings; furniture; machinery; vehicles; computer equipment. 

## Overview

This is a place to note any physical items you own for a longer term that are involved in running the business. Longer term means for more than one accounting period (i.e. more than 1 year).

These type of assets are classified as ‚Äòtangible‚Äô because you can physically touch them. And they‚Äôre often labelled as ‚Äòproperty, plant and equipment‚Äô on balance sheets. 

Selling this type of asset might be a taxable event so your accountant will want to know about it. They‚Äôll also need to track everything for depreciation purposes. And if you need to deal with repossession of an asset, note that here too.

## Exceptions

# Saving files for fixed assets

This ID should contain copies of records saved elsewhere in the system. That‚Äôs okay because these are static records. We want a place where you and/or your accountant can go to see the proof of ownership and value of any fixed assets in one place.

For example, an electrician‚Äôs business premises, van, and computers are fixed assets: 
- She manages the business premises in [[12.10]], the vehicle in [[12.40]], and the computers in [[14.10]]. 
- She copies the proof of ownership, valuations, and receipts here for her accountant. 
- And she also has a master finance record in [[13.11]] that includes a summary of her fixed assets because that‚Äôs how she rolls.

# 13.45 Current assets

## Description

Things owned for less than a year that help you run the business, like stock and inventory.

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place to note any physical items you own in the shorter term that are involved in running the business. Shorter term means for less than one accounting period (i.e. less than 1 year). 

During this time you expect to sell or consume these items. And/or they‚Äôre the type of thing that can be easily converted to cash if needed. These type of assets are classified as ‚Äòtangible‚Äô because you can physically touch them.

For instance, a furniture maker‚Äôs stock (finished products to sell to customers) and inventory (raw materials used to make the products) are current assets:
- He manages the stock and inventory in [[20-29]].

- And he also has a master finance record in [[13.11]] that includes a summary of his current assets because that‚Äôs how he rolls.

# 13.46 Intangible assets

## Description

Things you own that cannot be touched, like intellectual property, brand equity, and goodwill.

## Examples

Intellectual property such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets; digital assets such as domain names, software, and proprietary technology; goodwill assets such as brand equity and customer loyalty; licences and permits such as taxi medallions, liquor licences, and franchises.

## Overview

This is a place to note any non-physical items you own that are involved in running the business or contribute to its future worth. 

These type of assets are classified as ‚Äòintangible‚Äô because you can‚Äôt physically touch them.* Depending on what they are, intangible assets might be much more valuable than any fixed or current assets.

*For the pedants ‚Äì in the case of, say, a licence or permit, we‚Äôre talking about the concept of the thing here, not a printout of it.

# 13.54 Bills

## Description

The place to file processed bills.

## Examples

## Overview

We‚Äôve defined a ‚Äòbill‚Äô as something you must make time to pay. It‚Äôs outstanding and requires action, probably by a due date. As opposed to expenses that you have already paid for either on the spot (i.e. with a card), or via an automatic payment (i.e. a direct debit).

As per the ops manual, once you‚Äôve processed the bill in [[13.51]], store it here. For example, you have a food truck and receive a one-off bill for extra gas bottles delivered for an event. Put the bill in the liabilities inbox until you process it. Then permanently file it here and, if you want, add a copy to [[12.31]].

We recommend using the year-month method when saving this kind of paperwork so everything sorts neatly. And subfolder by bill issuer.

## Exceptions

These are not expenses that are paid on the spot or automatically, manage those in [[13.30]].

# Classifying automated bill payments as expenses

Normally we think of the bills that we receive by email or post as liabilities. But we made a decision here to classify things like _direct debits_ of bill payments as going ‚Äòstraight to expenses‚Äô. They‚Äôre paid automatically and you don‚Äôt need to plan a time to physically transfer money. Those types of liabilities tend to recur predictably, either monthly or quarterly. 

For instance, you‚Äôve set up direct debits for your utility bills. They‚Äôre paid automatically on the due date. Now they‚Äôre just expense transactions on your bank statement that you process and file in [[13.30]].

Compare this to other bills that arrive unpredictably, that you must pay manually. During one month you receive invoices from a carpenter, a car mechanic, and a new supplier who serviced your front office coffee machine. These are standalone bills for specific jobs and they all have different payment terms. 

As they arrive, put them in the liabilities inbox. Then set aside time later to pay them in order of urgency. The processed invoices are permanently filed here. And you might decide to add copies of them to [[12.14]], [[12.45]], and [[12.34]], respectively.

# How to be a small hero

If you can, consider paying invoices from sole traders on the day they‚Äôre received. One company used to do this for Lucy. She didn‚Äôt ask them to, they just did it. Every time.

And any other important documents related to your quarterly or annual tax returns (including the final tax return itself). Plus any correspondence with your accountant around preparing these returns.

But it‚Äôs not the _work_ that you do. It‚Äôs things that you‚Äôve found online or in real life, or perhaps that you‚Äôve created. 

It doesn‚Äôt fit anywhere else. It‚Äôs just a thing you wanted to save. And you don‚Äôt want it muddying other folders where work happens. Importantly, it‚Äôs not that important. It has nothing to do with business operations. If it wasn‚Äôt backed up it wouldn‚Äôt matter. If you lose it, you could probably download it again.

# Why are there no IDs here?

It‚Äôs difficult to imagine how these libraries might be used. So we didn‚Äôt want to commit to IDs yet. By leaving these sections blank, we can introduce everyone to the careful consideration that goes into making a new ID. 

If you‚Äôre ready to save things in this library, come over to the [[community]] and see what others are doing. Or ask us for advice. We‚Äôll figure it out together and eventually settle on some standard IDs. In the meantime, just keep things neat and tidy here.

# Leave yourself JDex notes

Remember to leave a note in your JDex when you save things in this library so you can find them easily. This is an important habit to get into, by the way. Don‚Äôt agonise if you‚Äôre unsure where something should go. Find the first relevant ID, make a decision, and leave yourself a note. Having a well-maintained JDex means you‚Äôll never lose anything again.

14 üíª Technology

## Description

This category is all about your business in the digital world.

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place to manage all the common computer-y things that most businesses have. Like hardware and software, setting up your online presence, and staying safe in cyberspace. 

And to be an honorary IT professional, this includes notes about configuration (i.e. all the stuff you did when you set something up). This is a nice example of ‚Äòworking the Decimal way‚Äô ‚Äì keeping notes to help your future self. It might be as simple as bullet points in your JDex or maybe a diagram, depending on what you‚Äôre documenting. Now you‚Äôll never forget what you did. 

## Exceptions

This category is for managing computer-y things that are common to _most_ businesses. Not for any ‚Äòcomputerised machines‚Äô that are specific to your operations or product, those go in [[12.20]], [[12.30]], or [[20-29]]. 

This category is for managing _your_ technology. If your product or service is related (e.g. you‚Äôre an IT consultant or run a computer repair shop) that goes in [[20-29]].

This category is not for managing technology related to workplace security or access (e.g cameras, passcards), that goes in [[12.22]] or [[12.32]].

# Isn‚Äôt everything ‚Äòtechnology‚Äô these days?

We have so many gadgets now, so there‚Äôs a lot of potential crossover between general technology, operations, and product. But we made a decision that this category is for classic computers, mobile devices, accessories, and other digital services that are common to _most_ businesses. The things that underpin everything else. And that you probably have more control over.

And it‚Äôs _not_ for computerised machines that are specific to your operations or product. Anything from card readers and payment machines, medical devices, manufacturing equipment, or that fancy robot vacuum cleaner in the back office.

Think about it like this. If you decide to open a completely different business, the gadgets you use in daily operations will change. But your over-arching IT setup probably won‚Äôt.

## Here‚Äôs a scenario

A gift shop has a card reader at the till (which is really just a paid service that happens to come with a gadget). The card reader needs a computer or iPad, network, and wifi to run ‚Äì these are managed here. And the card reader and its subscription go in [[12.34]] and [[14.32]], respectively.

Same goes for our dentist. Their x-ray machine sends scans to a computer in the treatment room via the network. Whether they own or lease this machine, they‚Äôll be paying someone to ensure it is mechanically sound and the software is updated. As above, the computers and network are managed here. And the x-ray machine and its support contract go in [[12.34]] and [[14.33]], respectively. 

If our dentist decided to convert the surgery into a gift shop, they can still use their existing computers, mobile devices, and network gear. But instead of an x-ray machine, they‚Äôll be running a card reader and till.

See [[14.14#When is an accessory ‚Äòtechnology‚Äô versus ‚Äòfront office operations‚Äô?]] for further rationale on this decision.

# 14.11 Computers & servers

## Description

Anything related to buying, maintaining, or selling a computer.

## Examples

Laptops; desktop computers, including things like Mac minis; physical servers; anything else classified as a computer, such as a Raspberry Pi.

## Overview

These are all the things that you typically connect a keyboard, mouse, and monitor to. That you do your work on, or that do work for you in the background. Note that computers and servers are both computers. A server is just a computer that you've assigned a special role.

This is a place to store important documents that come with the computer, such as manuals, warranties, and duplicates of purchase and repair receipts (from [[13.33]]). If you lease your computers, keep the overarching contracts and agreements here. And if you decide to sell anything, manage that here too.

This is also a place to keep any troubleshooting notes that you‚Äôve written and settings/configuration you‚Äôve applied. This comes in handy when you need to replace your computer or set up new computers for staff.

We recommend naming subfolders by purchase date and model.

## Exceptions

This is for physical computers that you control. If you pay for space on a virtual private server or offsite ‚Äòdedicated hosting service‚Äô in a data centre, those go in [[14.32]].

## Also see

If you sell a computer, record the details in [[13.26]] after processing the income.

# Configuration notes

We decided that notes related to the configuration of any computer in this category would live with the thing itself. 

For example, Johnny has configured a particular user account for when he logs in to his laptop. You might have a specific way to set up staff laptops, such as ensuring they all have the same applications, desktop background, and company screensaver. Save those details here for future reference.

# Computer lease contracts and agreements

If you lease your computers, we recommend keeping the overarching contracts and agreements here. It felt logical that computers should stay down in technology world. 

Conversely, in [[14.12]] we recommend that overarching mobile phone contracts and agreements should live up in operations. Because that feels like something that should be alongside other utilities. In this case, the device itself is separate to the contract, so it‚Äôs managed down here in technology. If you feel strongly either way, let‚Äôs discuss it.

# 14.12 Mobile devices

## Description

Anything related to buying, maintaining, or selling a smaller, handheld device.

## Examples

Phones; tablets; e-readers.

## Overview

This is basically the same as [[14.11]], but for smaller devices like phones and tablets. These are really just computers, but we tend to think of them differently. So it felt logical to split them out. 

Plus there are things that set them apart from regular computers. For instance, we tend to replace them more often, they‚Äôre more likely to be on some sort of payment plan, and we‚Äôre more likely to drop or lose them! Mobile devices also have a different security profile because they‚Äôre carried around in public, which is something to consider in [[14.40]].

This is a place to store important documents that come with the device, such as manuals, warranties, and duplicates of purchase and repair receipts (from [[13.33]]). And if you decide to sell anything, manage that here too.

This is also a place to keep any troubleshooting notes that you‚Äôve written and settings/configuration you‚Äôve applied. This comes in handy when you need to replace your mobile device or set up new devices for staff.

We recommend naming subfolders by purchase date and model.

## Exceptions

This is not for overarching mobile phone contracts or payment plan agreements, store those in operations at [[12.21]] or [[12.31]].

This is not for mobile phone bills or ‚Äòpay as you go‚Äô fees:
- process the payments in [[13.30]] or [[13.50]], 
- and if you like, store copies of the bills in operations at [[12.21]] or [[12.31]].

## Also see

If you sell a high-value mobile device, record the details in [[13.26]] after processing the income.

If you purchase a high-value mobile device, record the details in [[13.44]] after processing the asset.

# Configuration notes

We decided that notes related to the configuration of any mobile device in this category would live with the thing itself. For instance, you might have a preferred way to set up staff phones, such as ensuring they all have face ID activated, company wallpaper, and cloud storage and backup. Save those details here for future reference.

# Are mobile devices fixed assets?

# 14.13 Network devices

## Description

Anything related to buying, maintaining, or selling the devices that connect you to a network or the internet.

--

## Examples

Modems; routers; portable wifi dongles; mesh networks; firewalls.

## Overview

These are the devices that provide your network service. You might have one device, such as a combined ADSL modem/wifi router. Or a series of devices set up in combination. They're important enough to have their own ID because without network we usually can't get anything done.

This is a place to store important documents that come with the device, such as manuals, warranties, and duplicates of purchase and repair receipts (from [[13.33]]). And if you decide to sell anything, manage that here too.

This is also a place to keep any troubleshooting notes that you‚Äôve written and settings/configuration you‚Äôve applied. This comes in handy when you need to replace your network device or set up new devices for staff.

We recommend naming subfolders by purchase date and model.

## Exceptions

If you purchase a high-value network device, record the details in [[13.44]] after processing the asset.

If you‚Äôre paying off a network device, process the bills in [[13.30]] or [[13.50]].

See [[14.31]] for the overall service that a network device contributes to (e.g. user login, internet connectivity, wifi connectivity, printing, file services).

# Configuration notes

We decided that notes related to the configuration of any network device in this category would live with the thing itself. For instance, an ADSL modem/router needs to be configured so that it broadcasts wifi with a certain password. It has a web interface where you type things in boxes to create the wifi network. Record what you did here.

# 14.14 Accessories

## Description

## Examples

Printers and copiers; monitors; keyboards; mice and touchpads; styluses and pencils; cables and connectors; scanners; headphones and earbuds; watches; CD/DVD burners; landline telephones.

## Overview

This is a place to store important documents that come with the accessory, such as manuals, warranties, and duplicates of purchase and repair receipts (from [[13.33]]). And if you decide to sell anything, manage that here too.

This is also a place to keep any troubleshooting notes that you‚Äôve written and settings/configuration you‚Äôve applied. This comes in handy when you need to replace your accessory or set up new accessories for staff.

We recommend naming subfolders by purchase date and model.

## Exceptions

This is not for accessories related to data storage ‚Äì those go in [[14.21]].

This is not for accessories related to processing payments ‚Äì those go in [[12.34]].

If you pay a third party to use an accessory and they control it (e.g. a fancy photocopier with a service contract), manage that in [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].

## Also see

If you sell a high-value accessory, record the details in [[13.26]] after processing the income.

If you purchase a high-value accessory, record the details in [[13.44]] after processing the asset.

If you‚Äôre paying off an accessory, process the bills in [[13.30]] or [[13.50]].

See [[14.31]] for the overall service that an accessory contributes to (e.g. printing, scanning, photocopying).

## Further reading

# Configuration notes

We decided that notes related to the configuration of any accessory in this category would live with the thing itself. For instance, when you get a new printer there‚Äôs usually settings to choose and maybe a password. When you get a new monitor, you might choose certain colour, brightness, and energy settings. Record what you did here.

# Are accessories fixed assets?

We‚Äôve also (tentatively) assumed that some high-value accessories are classed as fixed assets, like computers. But it‚Äôll be up to your accountant and local tax guidelines if this is the case.

# When is an accessory ‚Äòtechnology‚Äô versus operations?

We made a decision that accessories that are common to _most_ businesses should live here in the technology world. But if you have things that are used to deliver your product or service, that not everyone has, or that are controlled by a third party, they should go in operations. 

We acknowledge that there‚Äôs potential for overlap here. So this is our thinking.

A printer should live here in [[14]] if:
- It‚Äôs a commodity that can be easily replaced (e.g. at any office supply store).
- It has functionality that can be easily replaced (e.g. at any print/copy store).

A printer should live in operations if:
- Not everyone has it (e.g. it prints till receipts or food service dockets).
- It‚Äôs business critical (e.g. it prints special product labels in your warehouse).
- It‚Äôs controlled by a third party and/or has specialised software.

We would also classify accessories that process payments as part of front office operations. For instance, tap and go card readers or card terminals. These are not common to all businesses and they‚Äôre usually associated with ongoing fees or payment plans. 

Note that if you use _your_ tablet as a point-of-sale (POS) system to control a card reader, that tablet still lives in [[14.12]]. It‚Äôs still a mobile device, plus you might use it for any number of things, not just payments.

# I can‚Äôt decide where my accessory goes

If you are torn about where any accessories should live, don‚Äôt stress. Remember that we can create wiki links in our JDex notes to other IDs. If we do this, we‚Äôre not going to lose anything. 

In the example above, we store our card reader in [[12.34]]. In that JDex note, we add a bullet point that says ‚ÄúThe iPad that controls this card reader is at [[14.12]]‚Äù.

This advice goes for anything else in your system where there‚Äôs a little ambiguity. Links are our friends.

# 14.21 Storage

## Description

The physical devices and cloud services that store your data.

## Examples

Physical storage devices like hard drives and USB sticks; cloud storage services
like Dropbox, iCloud, Google Drive, Amazon Web Services, or OneDrive/SharePoint.

## Overview

This is the _places a thing can be_. Probably where you have your classic file structure. In the old days, this might have been some mapped drives on the company network (e.g. G: and J:). But now we commonly use separate storage devices, as well as storage services.

This ID is where to save important documents that come with a physical storage device, such as manuals, warranties, and duplicates of purchase and repair receipts (from [[13.33]]). And if you use cloud services, include the account details here (not the passwords though, those go in your password manager!). 

This is also a place to keep any troubleshooting notes that you‚Äôve written and settings/configuration you‚Äôve applied. 

We recommend naming subfolders by purchase date and model.

## Exceptions

This is for devices and services that you save data to and that you (mostly) control. Third-party software and applications that perform a task _and_ contain data are noted in [[14.22]].

## Also see

If you sell a high-value storage device, record the details in [[13.26]] after processing the income.

If you purchase a high-value storage device, record the details in [[13.44]] after processing the asset.

If you‚Äôre paying off a storage device, process the bills in [[13.30]] or [[13.50]].

# Configuration notes

We decided that notes related to the configuration of any storage device or service in this category would live with the thing itself. For instance, when you get a fancy new hard drive there‚Äôs usually an interface with settings to select. The same goes for the various cloud storage services. There‚Äôs always settings and preferences to configure. Record what you did here.

# Are storage devices fixed assets?

We‚Äôve (tentatively) assumed that some high-value storage devices are classed as fixed assets, like computers. But it‚Äôll be up to your accountant and local tax guidelines if this is the case.

# Tracking storage devices

Physical storage devices have a certain security profile because many of them can be carried around in public. This is something to consider in [[14.40]].

We recommend recording their usual location. This might just be a note in your JDex. Are they in a drawer, cupboard, vehicle, locked safe? Are they used by a particular staff member and/or taken offsite? 

It might be worth having regular audits or reviews so you know where your stuff is. You don‚Äôt want someone carrying around your company's intellectual property on an insecure USB stick.

# 14.22 Data

## Description

## Examples

Documents in your computer‚Äôs documents folder; notes in a notes app; emails in an email client; other bespoke files in apps, software, or online platforms that you use; real-world data in a ledger or cashbook.

## Overview

Alright, this is important. If you lose this you go out of business. If this gets corrupted or stolen you go out of business. 

_Some_ of this data will live on a device you control or a cloud service in [[14.21]]. But it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôve got all sorts of stuff in other places. So that's what this ID is for. Recording what your data is and where you're keeping it.

Also, if you use a file synchronisation service, like Syncthing, store details about that here.

# What do you mean by data?

If the word ‚Äòdata‚Äô gives you hives, don‚Äôt stress. It‚Äôs just a nerdy way to say ‚Äòstuff‚Äô. 

It might help to think about it as ‚Äòblocks of stuff‚Äô. For instance, Johnny‚Äôs laptop home folder is one block that he cares about. The files for the Johnny.Decimal business (D85) is another block that lives elsewhere.

Each block is treated differently. D85 is precious so it‚Äôs stored in more places and backed up constantly. It‚Äôs also very large. So we don‚Äôt keep complete copies of it on our laptops, just the files we need. But the backups have _everything_.

Another example is Lucy‚Äôs design files that live in the Procreate app on her iPad. It wouldn‚Äôt be a disaster if they were lost, just annoying. So these are exported and backed up to our server less frequently.

## Customer data 

Note that we have not differentiated here between your data and your customers‚Äô data. It‚Äôs too difficult. If you‚Äôre storing something you‚Äôre responsible for treating it carefully, regardless of the source. If you _do_ hold customer data, then you‚Äôll need to be aware of applicable laws and regulations, as mentioned above.

# Recording information about your data

Do whatever works for you. You might use this JDex note, a document, or a spreadsheet. In our case, Johnny has an Airtable database of all our drives, what's on them, and how they‚Äôre backed up. It's handy to be able to see how many copies of a thing we have. 

And remember that not everything is on a computer. You might have important data in the physical world. For example, ledgers, cash books, desk diaries, or filing cabinets. If you‚Äôre a wedding celebrant, this includes your register.

We also recommend noting how important your data is (i.e. what classifies as a disaster if it‚Äôs lost and what is less important). 

If there‚Äôs demand, we could develop a database template like Johnny‚Äôs for everyone to use.

# Is data held by third parties backed up?

Don‚Äôt trust that important data is backed up by the third party that stores it. 

Maybe important customer data is in your email account or an online database. Or all your financial data is in accounting software. Don't assume that those services can/will recover your data if it's lost. There are ways to export and back this up yourself. We‚Äôll discuss this further in [[14.23]].

# Do you need a data retention policy?

If you deal with customer data or anything else that‚Äôs sensitive, you‚Äôll need a policy about this. It should outline how your business saves, retains, and backs up data in accordance with industry standards and compliance legislation.

## Ops manual

The GDPR is the [EU‚Äôs data protection law](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) ‚Äì if you hold data from EU citizens, then you‚Äôll need to read up on this.

# 14.23 Backups & recovery

## Description

Processes, schedules, and tests to ensure you don‚Äôt lose anything.

## Examples

Descriptions of what backup services you use, such as Time Machine, Windows Backup, Backblaze, Arq; notes on what data is backed up by which service; a summary of backup jobs, including the schedule.

## Overview

This completes the trifecta. You have data, on storage. Now you need to ensure that you don't lose it. The 3-2-1 backup strategy is acknowledged as the way to do it. Three copies of your data, on two different media, one copy offsite.

When choosing what to back up, we recommend thinking in terms of the data you defined in [[14.22]]. For instance, Johnny doesn‚Äôt necessarily think ‚ÄúI'll back up my whole laptop‚Äù. He focuses on particular data blocks, like the precious D85 folder ‚Äì one copy of which happens to be on the laptop. 

The Airtable database mentioned in [[14.22]] summarises what, where, and how often our data blocks are backed up. Keep your records in whatever way works for you.

For future reference, remember to note any configuration details you‚Äôve chosen in your backup service. And if you have sensitive stuff, like customer data, that should also be encrypted.

## Exceptions

## Also see

Remember to include a _printed_ copy of your data recovery instructions in [[11.23]]. Printed because you might not be able to access your computer in an emergency (e.g. due to damage, theft, or ransomware). Do not put passwords in these printouts, they never leave your password manager.

# Backing up versus saving a copy

Many of us, Lucy included, used to think that ‚Äòbacking up‚Äô meant saving important files to a hard drive or Dropbox at the end of the work day. People like Johnny will tell us that this is a copy, not a backup, and we should not rely on it.

You might _think_ that you have a backup because you store your data in the cloud. But if you mess up a file and don‚Äôt realise for a week, that isn‚Äôt going to help. You can‚Äôt ‚Äòroll back‚Äô to a version of that file from a week ago like you can with a backup. Sure, some cloud services offer restoring features, but they are _not_ backups.

A backup service is dedicated software that:
- automatically keeps historical versions of your data, 
- at a schedule you define, 
- that is easy to recover. 

The magic of a backup means that you can step back in time and recover whatever version of a file you need. And you don‚Äôt have to think about it ‚Äì it‚Äôs happening constantly in the background.

Whereas a copy ‚Äòsaved as‚Äô to a hard drive is singular, it happened at a particular time point. This might not be so useful when your computer crashes before you hit save. It also relies on you _remembering_ to do it.

Whether you conduct all, or most, of your business in the digital world, organising a trustworthy backup service is worth every penny.

# Backing up data on third-party services

We all have data spread around the internet. Remember that it‚Äôs _yours_. There are usually ways to export it from third-party services if you want to back it up. For instance, services like Gmail, Xero, and Instagram publish instructions on how to do this.

# Testing our backups on March 31st each year

A crucial component of backups, which everyone tends to neglect, is _testing that they work_. This should happen at least once a year. So we'll use World Backup Day (March 31st) to test our own and encourage others to do the same.

# Putting our IT pants on

Before we go deeper into this category, let‚Äôs take a small breath. 

We‚Äôre conscious that not everyone is a tech-head and we don‚Äôt want to scare you with too many IT concepts or words. But we also know that you‚Äôre a smart human ‚Äì you run a business! You can handle some tech talk.

One of the aims of this category is to help demystify some computer stuff. As business owners we do need to be on top of it. There‚Äôs too much at stake. Turns out it‚Äôs not actually that mysterious once you know the basics.

So if you‚Äôve looked ahead and are thinking ‚Äúwhat on Earth are internal and external software and services?‚Äù, bear with us. These words bubbled up naturally when we were figuring this section out. And they‚Äôre the kind of words that an IT professional might use.

**Internal software** might include things like: a personalised dashboard or widget; a script or complex formula in a spreadsheet; an automation in Airtable; a Zapier workflow; Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) customisations for Microsoft Office; 
or any type of in-house software you‚Äôve developed.

The base set of **internal services** that a business might supply to staff includes: user login; internet connectivity; wifi connectivity; printing; file services.

## Overview

By ‚Äòinternal software‚Äô we mean any software (fancy or low-code no-code), scripts, or automations you‚Äôve created to help the business. This ID is a place to list anything that you have and where it lives.

By ‚Äòinternal service‚Äô we mean anything you can do on a computer because there‚Äôs a combination of devices, software, and/or third-party services working together. This ID is a place to describe how the internal service was set up, for the administrator. And instructions for how to connect to the internal service, for users. Which might just be you wearing two different hats.

And the _user_ is interested in instructions on how to connect to, and use, each service. As well as troubleshooting advice and how to seek help. This is especially handy when you get new staff. Just point them to this ID.

The key difference is that the administrator is concerned with the devices and configurations that deliver a service. But the user couldn‚Äôt care less. They just want to get on the wifi, or print, or save their files.

So you, as the administrator, might end up with:
- A nice diagram on how your internet, network, and wifi are set up.
- Clear notes on how to set up and disable user logins for all your systems.
- Instructions to follow when a service isn‚Äôt working. 

And a bunch of cheat sheets for users that answer questions like: 
- How do I log in to my laptop and other systems? 
- How do I access the file server from the office? 
- How do I connect to the wifi? 
- How do I print and scan? 
- How do I access our systems if I‚Äôm working from home? 
- How do I get help if I can‚Äôt do any of these things?

# The difference between providing and connecting to an internal service

We‚Äôre going pretty deep here. But if you‚Äôre interested, here‚Äôs why we‚Äôre recommending that some details are saved in this ID versus others.

If a device‚Äôs configuration relates to _providing_ an internal service, then your config notes live with that device. For example, you type things in the web interface of an ADSL modem/router to create a wifi network. Then you add some bullets to [[14.13]] in your JDex so you can remember what you did.

But the instructions for _connecting_ to an internal service live alongside the service in this ID. For example, how to connect a laptop, phone, or printer to the wifi. Now we're ‚Äòconsuming the configuration‚Äô, if you like.

Here‚Äôs a scenario for our office wifi:

1. Our ISP has configuration ‚Äì the notes go in [[14.32]].

2. Our ADSL modem has configuration ‚Äì the notes go in [[14.13]].

3. Our wifi router has configuration. Ditto.

4. We just built a wifi internal service ‚Äì the notes live here, including:
- a list of the components involved, 
- a diagram of how it‚Äôs set up, 
- instructions on how to connect to it, 
- steps to follow if it‚Äôs not working.

Basically, just tell yourself a story on what you did so you‚Äôll remember in the future, and you‚Äôll know what devices to check when the wifi is down.

5. When we get a new iPad, we connect it to the wifi with the instructions in step 4.

# Using sub-IDs to create separate JDex notes

If you‚Äôd like more room for this information, consider using the sub-ID method to create separate JDex notes. 

For example:
- ‚Äò14.31+ Google dashboard‚Äô,
- ‚Äò14.31+ Excel script‚Äô, 
- ‚Äò14.31+ Airtable automation‚Äô. 

These notes will sort neatly under the parent ID. And they‚Äôre instantly findable by typing ‚Äò14.31+‚Äô in the search box of your notes app.

We encourage you to use this method whenever you would like more room in your JDex. This way you won‚Äôt over-clutter the note for the parent ID. 

This is one of the Decimal superpowers.

# 14.32 External software & services

## Description

Software and services created and/or managed by a third party.

## Examples

Internet service providers (ISPs); antivirus software; notes apps; accounting software; database services; software for creating graphics or editing videos; cloud storage services; virtual private network (VPN) providers; backup services; word processing or spreadsheet apps and software; task management software; domain registrars; web and email hosting; learning platforms; webinar and conferencing services; digital music subscriptions; industry-specific software.

## Overview

This is a place to record anything to do with third-party software, apps, and services for any computer or device. All the things that you have bought outright, or downloaded, or that you subscribe to for ongoing access.

Most of us will just have ‚Äòcommercial off-the-shelf‚Äô software. But if you‚Äôve paid to have something custom-made, note that here too. And if you‚Äôve downloaded things like fonts and wallpapers, those can also live here.

Remember to record any settings/configuration. For example, if you use a third-party email service, you might note settings you‚Äôve turned on or off, any filtering rules applied, and standard wording for staff signatures and out-of-office replies.

We made this ID so that there is space to save things _if you need to_. If you don‚Äôt have anything to save, that‚Äôs fine. If all you have is an account login, store it securely in your password manager and note its existence in [[14.41]].

## Exceptions

This is not a place to save account logins ‚Äì note their existence in [[14.41]] and store the logins securely in your password manager*.

This is not a place to manage ‚Äòreal-world‚Äô subscriptions and orders (e.g. fruit box, printer toner, or toilet paper deliveries) ‚Äì those go up in [[12.20]] or [[12.30]].

*Don‚Äôt have a password manager? Please stop reading this right now, and go and get a reputable one that you can use on all your business computers and devices. We use and recommend 1Password.

# Tell me more about external software and services

This is the companion to [[14.31]], but for stuff that you don't have direct control over. Software that you _buy or use for free_ rather than develop. Services that you _consume_ rather than provide. 

Note that an internal service might use an external service as one of its components. 

For example, our office network is an internal service. It is made possible by the devices that are stored in [[14.13]]. 

It also uses some external services, such as the ISP, Aussie Broadband. And eero Plus, which offers extra security, among other things. We would store those here.

# A sample list of external software and services

Here‚Äôs a list of the kinds of external software and services that a small business might use and record here. This is based on our current and past home offices, and some other businesses we know:

- Airtable
- Apple Music
- Aussie Broadband (ISP)
- Backblaze
- Bear
- Berkley Mono Typeface
- DaVinci Resolve
- Dropbox
- Evernote
- Google Workspace
- iCloud+
- Microsoft 365
- Mullvad (VPN)
- MYOB
- Netlify
- Norton AntiVirus
- Obsidian
- Porkbun
- Procreate
- Quicken
- RackNerd
- ScreenFlow
- Shopify
- Spotify
- Square
- Squarespace
- Thinkific
- Typora
- WinZip
- Xero
- Zendesk
- Zoom

Depending on what you do, there‚Äôll be a bunch of other stuff here. And depending on where you live, there might also be government software and services that are also relevant.

# Storing details about external software and services

Label subfolders with the name of the external software or service so they sort alphabetically.

# 14.33 Support contracts

## Description

Any paid agreement that means you can contact a human for technical support.

## Examples

## Overview

This ID is for any paid technical support that _you_ can access.

It might be a contract or service level agreement (SLA) with a real-world IT support business. Or perhaps you‚Äôve paid for a higher level of support from an online service, such as Google Workspace or Microsoft 365. 

Either way, keep any relevant official documents and/or notes on how to access help here.

## Exceptions

This is not for internal troubleshooting instructions that you have written, those live with the device or service they relate to.

This is not for customer management and support, that‚Äôs over in [[20-29]]. But if you use some sort of ‚Äòtechnology‚Äô that creates tickets to deal with customer feedback (e.g. Zendesk), that‚Äôs a third-party service, so note it in [[14.32]].

# 14.41 Accounts, passwords, & access

## Description

A record of all your logins and how you manage account access.

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place to list all of the types of logins you have and who has access to what. It can be handy to have a snapshot of everything, similar to the list in [[13.35]]. We also recommend keeping notes on how you deal with this stuff.

If this ID starts to get busy, consider using the extend-the-end method with the ‚Äò+‚Äô to nest sub-IDs under the parent ID.

**Do not store passwords here.**

The actual logins (i.e. usernames and passwords) should be in a reputable password manager. Or something else that‚Äôs encrypted. Never store your passwords in a plain text file. Ask us if you need help with password management.

# Why create a master list of accounts here?

We made a decision that [[14]] feels like a logical place to list _all_ logins and account access. Whether they‚Äôre internal or external, or related to technology, daily operations, or anything else. 

By _internal_ we mean things related to an internal service in your workplace, like logging in to your laptop or file servers. And by _external_ we mean any form of third-party website, software, or app.

And an account doesn‚Äôt have to be related to technology to be in this list. A weekly fruit box delivery to the back office isn‚Äôt ‚Äòtechnology‚Äô just because it‚Äôs ordered online. 

Keep any details about the everyday _management_ of the fruit box delivery in [[12.25]]. The fact that you have a login is noted here with all your other accounts.

# The case for a password manager

There‚Äôs no excuse these days for not having one. 

You don‚Äôt want everything out in the open. What if you get hacked? What if a staff member goes rogue and gets your banking login? Similarly, have you checked around the office or vehicles for logins taped to computers? We know they‚Äôre there. Find them and put them in a password manager.

Password managers make your digital life much more secure, and also less frustrating by speeding up the login process. They‚Äôre inexpensive. Just get one.

The main consideration is probably whether it‚Äôs just for you, or if you have staff that need to use it. And if so, should different staff members have different levels of access to what‚Äôs inside. 

In this case, look for password managers that make it easy to compartmentalise and share information. They‚Äôll have things like ‚Äòvaults‚Äô that you can populate with specific details. For example, only the person who does the banking and accounts should be able to see the banking and accounting software logins. 

Just search for ‚Äòpassword managers for business‚Äô and you‚Äôll get a bunch of hits. At JDHQ we use 1Password across all our computers and mobile devices.

# Using IDs in your password manager

When saving logins related to different parts of this system in your password manager, add the ID! Then you can search the app for the ID and a keyword.

1Password will let you do this with tags, others might as well. But adding it to the title or another field should also work.

For example, searching for:
- ‚Äò12.25‚Äô will show the logins in your back office related to food and beverage.
- ‚Äò12.25 coffee‚Äô will go straight to your coffee subscription login.
- ‚Äò12.42‚Äô will go straight to your vehicle insurance login, etc.

# Enabling and disabling account access

It‚Äôs easy to lose track of all the logins we have these days. That‚Äôs why we recommend keeping up-to-date notes on who has access to what. Especially if you have account administrators with higher levels of control.

This is handy day to day (i.e. what‚Äôs the plan for when admins are on leave ‚Äì who takes over?). It‚Äôs also useful when you‚Äôre onboarding and offboarding staff. If you‚Äôve written it all down, you won‚Äôt forget to cancel access when someone leaves.

## One scenario is your LinkedIn account

Two staff members are ‚Äòsuper admins‚Äô, which means they can do anything. One of them leaves on bad terms and you forget about their access. One day they log in and type lots of rude words on the profile page. Oh dear. Obviously this can get worse with any accounts that involve money or other sensitive data.

In this case, we‚Äôd make a sub-ID, ‚Äò14.41+ LinkedIn‚Äô, and write details about the account here. Who has access to it and so on. 

You could keep lists of quick-links like this:
- [Add admins on your page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a569144).
- [Remove your page admin‚Äôs role](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1481276).

# Instructions on how you access government services

This also feels like a good place to remind yourself and other key staff how the business accesses online government services. Things like portals for lodging and paying taxes or receiving assistance. 

Logging in to such services often requires a physics degree and a lot of patience. So be kind to your future selves and write some instructions here.

# An example: How Johnny managed Microsoft logins

Johnny once had a developer subscription that enabled him to access many Microsoft accounts. He made a JDex note about how the accounts were set up and inter-related. 

It was complex. You couldn‚Äôt log in to this thing before logging in to that thing. He even set up different browser profiles and explained in the note what each was for. Because sometimes he needed to be logged in as an admin, and sometimes as a user.

He kept links to all the login pages, plus clear instructions on what to do. This was a direct replacement for browser bookmarks, where it‚Äôs easy for this sort of thing to get lost. 

Hopefully your work life isn‚Äôt this complex. But this is one of the many things you could use this ID for to create a little bit of serenity.

# 14.42 Technical cybersecurity

## Description

Defining the threats to the business and actively protecting against them.

## Examples

## Overview

It‚Äôs imperative to have measures in place to protect your data and your customers‚Äô data. There‚Äôs too many heartbreaking stories of people losing everything from scams, hackers, phishing, malware, viruses, and other threats. 

So if you‚Äôve been putting this off, it‚Äôs time to stop procrastinating ‚Äì the bad guys aren‚Äôt. The good news is, there‚Äôs a lot of great information and help available now. 

This is a place to keep anything related to the ‚Äòtechnical‚Äô aspects of managing your cybersecurity. What is your overall plan? Is it active now or do you need to organise some professional advice? Does your type of business have a higher risk profile than others? And what are the devices and software that you‚Äôll rely on?

## Exceptions

This is for your overall cybersecurity plan ‚Äì the devices or software involved are managed elsewhere (e.g. a firewall lives in [[14.13]], antivirus software lives in [[14.32]]).

## Also see

[[14.43]] for the human side of things.

## Further reading

# Where do I even start with cybersecurity?

If you‚Äôre new to all this, some initial steps to take might include:
- Reading as much as you can on the topic.
- Doing a trustworthy online cybersecurity health check.
- Finding online courses for you and your staff.
- Booking an in-house assessment from a reputable provider.
- Signing up for email alerts on new threats.
- Checking that antivirus and security software is up to date and always running.
- Ensuring your firewall devices and/or software are set up correctly.
- Ensuring that the operating systems on all devices are the latest version.
- Drafting policies around all this stuff to keep staff informed.

# 14.43 Behavioural cybersecurity

## Description

How the business will behave when interacting with the digital world.

## Examples

## Overview

In contrast to [[14.42]], here we‚Äôre talking about the ongoing stuff that you and your humans do. This is harder than the technical aspects ‚Äì that‚Äôs set-and-forget. You must be constantly aware of the behavioural side of things.

So this is a place to plan and manage anything related to behaviours that strengthen your cybersecurity. A written policy on behaviour expectations, research you‚Äôve done, information sheets on different topics for staff, and whatever else you need.

## Exceptions

Compliance obligations around things like privacy and data handling go in [[11.13]].

If you need to write a data retention policy, that lives in [[14.22]].

If you organise formal cybersecurity training, manage that in [[11.50]] and note who completed it in [[11.42]].

## Also see

How you respond to a cybersecurity incident should also be included in [[11.23]].

Having good policies and behaviours here will help with [[14.44]].

## Further reading

# What kind of things are in a cybersecurity policy?

A cybersecurity policy might address behaviours around things like: 
- passwords, passphrases, and multi-factor authentication, 
- threat awareness when using email, websites, and search engines,
- threat awareness when answering phone calls,
- what is ‚Äòacceptable use‚Äô of the business‚Äô network, computers, and devices, 
- use of personal devices for business purposes, 
- working from home, 
- network protection,
- keeping operating systems and antivirus software up to date, 
- responsible data handling,
- use of storage devices,
- and how to report a threat or get help if a security event occurs.

# How do you and your staff behave online? 

How do you treat email? Do you understand phishing attacks? Do you know not to post sensitive stuff on social media? Are you aware that websites in search engine results can be fake? What happens if someone gets an email that begins ‚ÄúDear beloved friend, I am a deposed prince that needs help with a cash transfer...‚Äù?

This also includes behaviours around texts and phone calls. We‚Äôve all received ‚Äòurgent‚Äô unsolicited texts and calls trying to lure us into clicking a link or handing over money. 

These people (and their bots) are ruthless. And they‚Äôre especially dangerous when they impersonate banks, utilities, or government services that we all use and trust. Your antivirus software can‚Äôt help if you give someone your bank details over the phone.

Have a search for cybersecurity and phishing awareness training, there‚Äôs lots of options these days. Sign up to some mailing lists. Learn what the new hacks and scams are. Stay vigilant because threats can come from anywhere.

# What makes a good password?

There‚Äôs plenty of advice online about creating strong passwords. But we‚Äôd recommend deferring to your trusty password manager to generate them for you. 

There are times when _you_ might need to create a strong, memorable password. For example, the password that unlocks your password manager. You can‚Äôt store this in the app, it has to live in your head. **Never ever write that password down.** We will disown you. 

We also recommend having a _verbal_ password that you and your staff can use on the phone to verify your identities. We read an article about a scam where people impersonate business owners, hence the warning. 

It goes like this. A business owner went overseas to a conference. They mentioned specific details in their out-of-office message. A scammer got the message, called the office, and pretended to be the boss. ‚ÄúHey, Paris is great, quick favour, my card failed, can you transfer $$$ to this other account, thanks, gotta run!‚Äù. This is where you say, ‚Äúsure, what‚Äôs the password?‚Äù and they hang up.

# 14.44 Cyber insurance, incidents, & claims

## Description

Policies, coverage details, incident reports, and claim forms for your digital world.

## Examples

Depending on the policy, cyber insurance may cover costs related to: extortion or ransomware; data breaches and security; loss or release of customer data; interruptions to business operations caused by a cyber event; recovery of lost business data; being sued by a third party for damages caused by a cyber event.

## Overview

This is a place for insurance that covers the business interacting with the digital world. Anything related to being on a computer, including hacks, scams, phishing, data leaks, viruses and malware, or ransomware attacks. 

It‚Äôs likely you‚Äôll find it easier to obtain cyber insurance (and make a claim) if you can show that you have implemented a cybersecurity plan and have proper password management.

This is also where to store incident reports that might become part of a claim.

# Why is cyber insurance here?

We recommend that insurance details should live next to the thing that is being insured. This will help your brain find things, and ensure other relevant information is nearby if you‚Äôre dealing with a claim or policy renewal.

# What other related insurances might go here?

If you have specific theft or damage insurance for high-value computers, devices, or accessories consider storing that here too. Otherwise, that would go in [[12.12]].

And if your business sells a technology product or provides technology services, then you might also have ‚Äòtechnology errors and omissions‚Äô (E&O) insurance. This protects against an incident that affects customers because of an error in your product or service. Consider storing that here too. Otherwise, that would go in [[11.22]].

# 14.51 Domain & DNS management

## Description

Anything related to registering domains and DNS management.

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place to store any notes and documents related to registering domains and DNS management. This also includes things like SSL certificates. These can expire so you need reminders to keep them up to date.

For must of us, this ID might just contain the details of who our domain registrar and DNS provider are. 99% of the time, the domain registrar also handles the DNS. 

You might also keep research and shortlists here when you‚Äôre searching for a domain name. And if you‚Äôre paying a professional to do all this for you, then keep their contact details and what they do here.

## Exceptions

## Also see

Any services you use that are related to registering a domain or DNS management live in [[14.32]].

## Further reading

# Your domain is very important 

Your domain name is very important because you can usually only ‚Äòbuy‚Äô them for a year (technically it‚Äôs a rental). So people forget to renew them and then whoops, everything‚Äôs gone. 

So put a reminder in your calendar. You can build another website anytime. But if someone else gets your domain name, it‚Äôs all over.

# A domain is not a website

This is a little technical, but it‚Äôs handy to know about. If your eyes are glazing over, stay with us.

_A domain is separate to any services that you run on it._ Whether that‚Äôs a website, blog, forum, email, or a bunch of other stuff like remote logins, VPNs, or file servers. So once you‚Äôve registered your domain, you can use it for all sorts. 

## A big one for business owners is email

We often see vans proudly displaying their website (e.g. carolscupcakes.com) and email (e.g. carolscupcakes@gmail.com) in big letters down the side. 

Unfortunately Carol doesn‚Äôt know that she can easily set up a personalised email (e.g. hello@carolscupcakes.com) using her domain and her existing gmail account. As a sole trader, Lucy didn‚Äôt know this either. Until Johnny came along, tapped a few keys, and did some DNS magic.

## Domain name service

So that‚Äôs what DNS means: domain name service. All the services that can run on your domain. For example, the domain, johnnydecimal.com, is registered at Porkbun. And we use other services to provide the website, email, and blog. But Porkbun is where we _point our domain to those services_. 

It‚Äôs like the most important address book. So when someone wants to visit our website at johnnydecimal.com, we‚Äôve told Porkbun to send them to our web hosting service. When someone wants to send us an email to hello@johnnydecimal.com, we‚Äôve told Porkbun to send them to our email service.

In the future, we could make an ops manual to help with this kind of thing. Let us know if that‚Äôs something you‚Äôd like.

# 14.52 Websites, blogs, & communities

## Description

The general admin related to setting up and managing websites, blogs, and communities.

## Examples

Whether you set up your site with a third-party service, hired a web designer, or coded it yourself, you might record things like: how it‚Äôs built; where it‚Äôs hosted; how to update it; where the logins are in your password manager; where the code is (if you wrote it); links to the master creative files; and anything else that‚Äôs important.

## Overview

This is a place to store any details related to the set up and ongoing management of websites that you control. It‚Äôs about the underlying _administration_ of a website. Not what‚Äôs on it.

Think about it from the perspective of a new staff member that you‚Äôve asked to look after your website. What are all the little details they need to know?

We also recommend recording any configuration or behind-the-scenes settings. For example, if you‚Äôre connecting a domain from a third-party registry on Squarespace, you‚Äôll need to type in the DNS details. Help your future self by noting what you did.

This includes _blogs and communities_. But for simplicity, we‚Äôve focused on websites here. If you do manage a blog or community, just follow the same advice.

## Exceptions

This is not where you produce and store the content that you publish on a website, that happens in [[80-89]] and [[90-99]].

# What is website hosting?

Your website is just a bunch of files on a disk somewhere. Your web server (the host) is pointed at those files and is always listening for requests. When someone visits your website, the web server shows them the page. This process is fundamentally unchanged since it was invented in 1991.

There‚Äôs nothing stopping you hosting a website yourself. But that‚Äôd be daft. What happens when your internet is down or when you move house? And do you really want thousands of people using your home internet connection to access the website? 

So instead, there are website hosting services. We use Netlify, but there‚Äôs many others. This is their business so you get all sorts of advantages. For example, their web servers are all around the world so people don‚Äôt have to connect to a server where we live. That‚Äôs all ‚Äòhosting‚Äô is.

# Linking to the master creative files for websites

We recommend that this ID includes links to the location of the master creative files for your website. _Because they do not live here_. For example, logos, banners, photos, videos, or final approved wording.

If these are files that you reuse over and over, there should be one copy in [[80-89]]. When you need something for a job, you go there and get it. This might include your logo, colour palette details, product images, or staff photos and bios.

Conversely, if there are files that are specific to a particular job, they should live in that job‚Äôs folder in [[90-99]]. For example, you make a new product video for the site ‚Äì the script, raw footage, and final export live in that job‚Äôs folder.

# 14.53 Social media

## Description

The general admin related to setting up and managing social media accounts.

## Examples

Whether you have one account, or multiple, you might record things like: the handles; if it‚Äôs a business account, such as Instagram for Business; where the logins are in your password manager; if two-factor authentication is turned on (it should be); who the admins are; how to update the profile and post different types of media; if there‚Äôs an associated account, such as Linktree or Canva; image sizes and character limits by platform; links to the master creative files; how to set up your AV equipment for a video shoot; and anything else that‚Äôs important.

## Overview

Similar to [[14.52]], this is a place to store any details related to the set up and ongoing management of social media accounts that you control. It‚Äôs about the underlying _administration_ of a social media account. Not what‚Äôs on it.

Think about it from the perspective of a new staff member that you‚Äôve asked to look after your social media. What are all the little details they need to know?

We also recommend recording any configuration or behind-the-scenes settings. Especially stuff related to privacy and security, commenting, and direct messaging. We‚Äôre not social media experts.* But we‚Äôve noticed that there‚Äôs _a lot_ of settings these days, so keep an eye on them.

If you decide to close an account and download your data, you could store that here too.

*If you _are_ an expert, it would be great to see you in this [[community]] thread.

## Exceptions

This is not where you produce and store the content that you post on social media, that happens in [[80-89]] and [[90-99]].

## Also see

Any services related to using a social media account are noted in [[14.32]] (e.g. things like Linktree or Canva).

# What do you mean by social media?

By social media, we mean any third-party platform where you can post and publish words, images, or video, that _isn‚Äôt_ your own website, blog, community, or newsletter. And that people can interact with in some way. For simplicity, we recommend that it sits under one umbrella here.

# Storing details for multiple social media accounts

To avoid cluttering this JDex note, we recommend using the extend-the-end method to create sub-IDs under this parent ID. For example:
- ‚Äò14.53+ Instagram‚Äô,
- ‚Äò14.53+ LinkedIn‚Äô,
- ‚Äò14.53+ YouTube‚Äô,

And to neatly store files in your file system, create one subfolder per platform so they sort alphabetically. Then use the year-month method to name files so they sort by date.

# Linking to the master creative files for social media

We recommend that this ID includes links to the location of the master creative files for your social media accounts. _Because they do not live here_. For example, logos, banners, photos, videos, or approved profile pics and wording.

If these are files that you reuse over and over, there should be one copy in [[80-89]]. When you need something for a job, you go there and get it. This might include your logo or profile pic, colour palette details, or product shots.

Conversely, if there are files that are specific to a particular job, they should live in that job‚Äôs folder in [[90-99]]. For example, you make a new product video for reels ‚Äì the raw footage, hashtags, and approved post wording live in that job‚Äôs folder.

## Order and calm 

Our goal for the two creative categories is that they‚Äôre orderly, calm places. The type of files and projects that go here are often littered throughout your entire system. And so much time is wasted clicking around trying to find them. 

‚ÄúWhen did I last use the logo?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs this the hi-res version?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the final PDF of the new menu design?‚Äù

And into the habit of having a neat set of folders containing a master copy of everything.

# 14.54 Electronic mailing lists & updates

## Description

The general admin related to setting up and managing electronic mailing lists and updates.

## Examples

Whether you use a third-party service or manage this yourself, you might record things like: dates to send newsletters and other updates; the process for developing, reviewing, and approving content; where the logins are in your password manager; who the admins are and what permissions other users have; preferred templates, image sizes, and other specifications; links to the master creative files; troubleshooting tips; and anything else that‚Äôs important.

## Overview

Similar to [[14.53]], this is a place to store any details related to the set up and ongoing management of updates that you control. Things like email newsletters and SMS updates. It‚Äôs about the underlying _administration_ of the account and mailing list. Not what you send out.

Think about it from the perspective of a new staff member that you‚Äôve asked to look after your mailing list and updates. What are all the little details they need to know?

We also recommend recording any configuration or behind-the-scenes settings. For example, depending on the platform, certain tracking options may be enabled by default. If you edit these, leave notes here.

## Exceptions

This is not where you manage your actual email account, that‚Äôs up in [[14.32]] and [[14.41]].

This is not where you produce and store the content you send out, that happens in [[80-89]] and [[90-99]].

If you do printed mail-outs, manage the mailing lists in [[XX-XX]], and the content development in [[80-89]] and [[90-99]].  

## Also see

Any services related to managing newsletters and updates are noted in [[14.32]].

Keep in mind any applicable privacy and data protection laws when dealing with mailing lists, as noted in [[11.13]] and [[14.22]].

# Choosing a platform

If you‚Äôd like to start doing this kind of thing, it‚Äôs worth researching different platforms. Most people have heard of Mailchimp because they‚Äôve been around for years. But a quick search shows there‚Äôs lots of options now. So have a look at the features and pricing and see which platform is right for your business.

# Storing mailing lists

Most businesses use a third-party platform for newsletters and updates. So that‚Äôs where your mailing list lives. 

Because Johnny‚Äôs a nerd, he manages email newsletters himself. He‚Äôll _probably_ store his (encrypted) list here. But there is some overlap with customer management. In times like this we ask ourselves ‚Äúwhere would a new staff member look for this?‚Äù. We reckon they‚Äôd try here first. 

And remember, mailing lists contain personal data. So you need to be aware of applicable privacy and data protection laws (like the GDPR). Especially if you decide to switch platforms and need to export data, or if a subscriber requests a copy of their data from you.

# What if I don‚Äôt need to put anything here?

This feels like a place to reinforce that there‚Äôll be parts of this system that are busier for some people than others. 

For example, you subscribe to a third-party service and send out four email newsletters a year. The service‚Äôs existence is noted in [[13.35]], [[14.32]], and [[14.41]]. And now you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúyou want me to make notes about it here too?‚Äù. 

If you do all your work inside your newsletter platform and have nothing to put here right now, don‚Äôt stress. You don‚Äôt need to fill IDs just because we made them. _Other people_ will put things here. We want to ensure they have a place.

# Linking to the master creative files for updates

We recommend that this ID includes links to the location of the master creative files for your newsletters and updates. _Because they do not live here_. For example, logos, banners, photos, videos, or words.

If these are files that you reuse over and over, there should be one copy in [[80-89]]. When you need something for a job, you go there and get it. This might include your logo, colour palette details, or product shots.

Conversely, if there are files that are specific to a particular job, they should live in that job‚Äôs folder in [[90-99]]. For example, you write the July issue of your newsletter ‚Äì the drafts and approved words, plus any images, live in that job‚Äôs folder.

## Order and calm 

Our goal for the two creative categories is that they‚Äôre orderly, calm places. The type of files and projects that go here are often littered throughout your entire system. And so much time is wasted clicking around trying to find them.

# 14.90 ‚ñ† Technology library üìö

## Description

A place to put information that‚Äôs related to this category, kinda interesting, mostly unimportant, and definitely doesn‚Äôt fit elsewhere.

## Examples

## Overview

Caution. This is a place for when there is no other place. Don‚Äôt get lazy and dump stuff here that is important and/or has a home elsewhere in the system.

This might be information that you found interesting or might be useful someday. But right now, it‚Äôs not strongly related to any other ID. And it would not make sense to clutter an existing ID or create a new one for it.

It‚Äôs a library so we want to keep it neat. Label any files with clear descriptions and use the year-month method in case the information is time sensitive.

## Exceptions

# Why did you include a library in each category?

We wanted to be realistic and acknowledge that sometimes there is miscellanea that accumulates over time. It could be anything ‚Äì a document, photo, URL, email, note, or a physical item. But it‚Äôs not the _work_ that you do. It‚Äôs things that you‚Äôve found online or in real life, or perhaps that you‚Äôve created. 

It doesn‚Äôt fit anywhere else. It‚Äôs just a thing you wanted to save. And you don‚Äôt want it muddying other folders where work happens. Importantly, it‚Äôs not that important. It has nothing to do with business operations. If it wasn‚Äôt backed up it wouldn‚Äôt matter. If you lose it, you could probably download it again.

# Why are there no IDs here?*

It‚Äôs difficult to imagine how these libraries might be used. So we didn‚Äôt want to commit to IDs yet. By leaving these sections blank, we can introduce everyone to the careful consideration that goes into making a new ID. 

If you‚Äôre ready to save things in this library, come over to the [[community]] and see what others are doing. Or ask us for advice. We‚Äôll figure it out together and eventually settle on some standard IDs. In the meantime, just keep things neat and tidy here.

*Actually, there‚Äôs one ID here ‚Äì [[14.91]] ‚Äì this category felt like the right place for it.

# Leave yourself JDex notes

Remember to leave a note in your JDex when you save things in this library so you can find them easily. This is an important habit to get into, by the way. Don‚Äôt agonise if you‚Äôre unsure where something should go. Find the first relevant ID, make a decision, and leave yourself a note. Having a well-maintained JDex means you‚Äôll never lose anything again.

# 14.91 Curated lists of online resources

## Description

If you have treasured collections of links that you don‚Äôt want to lose, store them here.

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place to store any curated lists of where you go online for business-related information. These lists have probably been developed over time, are specific to your work, and you don‚Äôt want to lose them.

Maybe you want to store a copy outside of your browser bookmarks for reasons. Or perhaps you want to share them with others. For example, when onboarding new staff you might provide a list of resources like:
- industry newsletters to sign up for, 
- trusted websites for research and reading,
- blogs and RSS feeds to follow; communities to join, 
- YouTube or social media accounts to follow, 
- or trade journals to review.

Note that this is a ‚Äòspecial-case‚Äô ID that happens to be in the technology library. Organise the rest of this library as you wish.

## Exceptions

## Further reading

# Why did you put this ID here?

If you keep lists like this, they‚Äôll no doubt contain information relevant to all categories, not just technology. But we‚Äôve recommended putting them here because they‚Äôre accessible _on_ technology. And it might be handy to have them all in one ID. 

If you actively use your browser bookmarks and keep them well organised, you might not need this ID. But for those of us who don‚Äôt, here‚Äôs an alternative.

# 15.XX Business travel

## Description

A neat template to organise work-related trips.

## Examples

## Overview

This is a place to organise any sort of (probably) longer-distance, business-related travel that isn‚Äôt day-to-day operations. 

Things like attending meetings, conferences, and expos, or any event where you represent the business. 

Or perhaps you need to travel to complete a project. For instance, a photographer who travels overseas to do a photoshoot. Or a tradesperson who travels interstate to complete a construction contract.

Whether it‚Äôs short term or longer, at the bare minimum you need to get there. 

You might need to catch a plane to attend a meeting in another city, but just for the day. Store the plane tickets and any expenses here. If you end up having to stay overnight, record your accommodation details too. If the next meeting is overseas, you might also need visas, vaccinations, and other documents. 

That‚Äôs why we created a work trip template, so everything stays neat and tidy:
- 10 Planning
- 20 Travel documents & visas    ‚Üê specific to the trip
- 30 Transport
- 40 Accommodation
- 50 Itineraries & schedules
- 60 Expenses to claim

## Exceptions

This is not for daily vehicle running expenses or deductions, those go in [[12.43]].
