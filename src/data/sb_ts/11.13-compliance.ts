      "overview": "You have a registered business and the legal permission to provide a product or service. Now you must adhere to the regulatory environment that you are trading in. Again, this will depend entirely on what you do.\n\nThere may be many different local, state, national, or international laws or requirements to be aware of. And who knows, if you run a fishing business, things like the ‘law of the sea’ may apply.\n\nCompliance might mean that:\n\n- Your business must obey certain laws, regulations, or codes of practice.\n- Your business must undergo one-off or ongoing inspections or audits.\n- You and your staff must do ongoing training.\n- The products you sell or manufacture must meet certain standards.\n\nEither way, store copies of regulations and proof that you’re complying with them here. This is an important ID to keep up-to-date in your JDex and to set reminders for to ensure you stay above board.",
      "alsoSee": "Manage ongoing training or education in [[11.50]], but store a copy of the proof of completion here if it helps you meet compliance obligations."
