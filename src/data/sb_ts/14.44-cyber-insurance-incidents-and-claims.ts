Anything related to being on a computer, including hacks, scams, phishing, data leaks, viruses and malware, or ransomware attacks.\n\nIt’s likely you’ll find it easier to obtain cyber insurance (and make a claim) if you can show that you have implemented a cybersecurity plan and have proper password management.\n\nThis is also where to store incident reports that might become part of a claim.",
