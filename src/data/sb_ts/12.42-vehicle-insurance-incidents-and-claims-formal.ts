      "overview": "Again, when we say ‘vehicle’ this will mean different things to different businesses. But we needed a catch-all label here. It could be a car, boat, or rickshaw. But if it’s covered under a vehicle insurance policy, put it here. In contrast, a bicycle or e-scooter, might be covered as a mobile item under your office/home contents policy.\n\nInsurance companies often have commercial policies that are designed for business owners. So it might pay to look around to see what’s right for you. And note that some insurances may be required by law. For instance, in Australia third party personal injury insurance is compulsory for business vehicles.\n\nIf you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or registration. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.\n\nThis is also a place to save incident reports that might become part of a claim. For example, something is stolen and you file a police report.",
