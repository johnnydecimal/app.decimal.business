      "overview": "This is a place to manage larger structural projects that have an end. And once done, you move into back or front office operations mode.\n\nAs such, we recommend that any equipment ordered as part of the project be stored in those sections.\n\nThis ID might be empty for many businesses. Like us. Our office is a room in a rented house. We will never be renovating it.\n\nHowever, it will be very busy for others. The hair salon above is based on a friend who spent a hectic 6 months fitting out a new space.",
      "exceptions": "Daily fix-its and ongoing maintenance goes in [[12.15]].\n\nBack or front office equipment ordered as part of a project goes in [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].\n\nFit-outs and renovations for mobile premises go in [[12.44]].",
      "rationale": "We made a decision that these projects are about building and installing things that you can’t really take with you – they were designed for a specific location – and they’re unlikely to have an ops manual.\n\nWhereas back or front office equipment ordered as part of the project might have service contracts or staff training and cleaning manuals linked to them, so they belong in operations.\n\nFor instance, the hair salon’s espresso machine in the kitchen area and massage chairs by the sinks."
