The service’s existence is noted in [[13.35]], [[14.32]], and [[14.41]]. And now you’re thinking “you want me to make notes about it here too?”.\n\nIf you do all your work inside your newsletter platform and have nothing to put here right now, don’t stress. You don’t need to fill IDs just because we made them. _Other people_ will put things here. We want to ensure they have a place."
