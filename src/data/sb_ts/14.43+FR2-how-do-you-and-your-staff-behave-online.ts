What happens if someone gets an email that begins “Dear beloved friend, I am a deposed prince that needs help with a cash transfer...”?\n\nThis also includes behaviours around texts and phone calls. We’ve all received ‘urgent’ unsolicited texts and calls trying to lure us into clicking a link or handing over money.\n\nThese people (and their bots) are ruthless. And they’re especially dangerous when they impersonate banks, utilities, or government services that we all use and trust. Your antivirus software can’t help if you give someone your bank details over the phone.\n\nHave a search for cybersecurity and phishing awareness training, there’s lots of options these days. Sign up to some mailing lists. Learn what the new hacks and scams are. Stay vigilant because threats can come from anywhere."
