But the more we thought about it, we werenâ€™t sure that a one-size-fits-all approach was the right way.\n\nSo in this section weâ€™ve suggested that vehicles be classified into two buckets â€“ â€˜formalâ€™ and â€˜informalâ€™.\n\nFormal vehicles include anything that requires official registrations and inspections, whether itâ€™s motorised or not.\n\nIf it travels on a public road and requires insurance, or does anything serious like carrying passengers or dangerous goods, then manage it in [[12.41]], [[12.42]], [[12.43]], [[12.44]], and [[12.45]].\n\nInformal vehicles do not fit the above description. Manage those, as well as any public or shared transportation that your business uses, in [[12.46]].\n\nIf you disagree with this classification, do what works for you and note where everything is in your JDex."
