      "overview": "Caution. This is a place for when there is no other place. Donâ€™t get lazy and dump stuff here that is important and/or has a home elsewhere in the system.\n\nThis might be information that you found interesting or might be useful someday. But right now, itâ€™s not strongly related to any other ID. And it would not make sense to clutter an existing ID or create a new one for it.\n\nItâ€™s a library so we want to keep it neat. Label any files with clear descriptions and use the year-month method in case the information is time sensitive.\n\n### Why are there no IDs here?\n\nItâ€™s difficult to imagine how these libraries might be used. So we didnâ€™t want to commit to IDs just yet. By leaving these sections blank, we thought it might be a good way to introduce everyone to the careful consideration that goes into making a new ID.\n\nIf youâ€™re ready to save things in this library, come over to the [[community]] and see what others are doing or ask us for advice. Weâ€™ll figure it out together and eventually settle on some standard IDs. In the meantime, just keep things neat and tidy here.\n\n### Leave yourself JDex notes\n\nRemember to leave a note in your JDex when you save things in this library so you can find them easily.\n\n(This is a good habit to get into, by the way. Donâ€™t agonise if youâ€™re unsure where something should go. Find the first relevant ID, make a decision, and leave yourself a note. Having a well-maintained JDex means youâ€™ll never lose anything again.)",
      "exceptions": "Things that contain information that is specific to your business, and that donâ€™t fit elsewhere, should go in [[13.14]].",
      "rationale": "We wanted to be realistic and acknowledge that sometimes there is miscellanea that accumulates over time.\n\nIt could be anything â€“ a document, photo, URL, email, note, or a physical item. But itâ€™s not the _work_ that you do. Itâ€™s things that youâ€™ve found online or in real life, or perhaps that youâ€™ve created.\n\nIt doesnâ€™t fit anywhere else. Itâ€™s just a thing you wanted to save. And you donâ€™t want it muddying other folders where work happens.\n\nImportantly, itâ€™s not that important. It has nothing to do with business operations. If it wasnâ€™t backed up it wouldnâ€™t matter. If you lose it, you could probably download it again."
