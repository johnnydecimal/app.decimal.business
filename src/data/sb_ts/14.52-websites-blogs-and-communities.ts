      "overview": "This is a place to store any details related to the set up and ongoing management of websites that you control. It’s about the underlying _administration_ of a website. Not what’s on it.\n\nThink about it from the perspective of a new staff member that you’ve asked to look after your website. What are all the little details they need to know?\n\nWe also recommend recording any configuration or behind-the-scenes settings. For example, if you’re connecting a domain from a third-party registry on Squarespace, you’ll need to type in the DNS details. Help your future self by noting what you did.\n\nThis includes _blogs and communities_. But for simplicity, we’ve focused on websites here. If you do manage a blog or community, just follow the same advice.",
