      "text": "This ID is for the daily sending and receiving that most of us do. But if shipping your product to customers is a major part of your business, that is a process that needs its own space in [[20-29]]. Whether you send large freight consignments from a warehouse or run an Etsy shop from home, you’ll have all sorts of things to manage.\n\nFor example, a web design agency manages all of their sending here. It’s primarily business administration and they don’t ship physical products to customers. They do things like:\n\n- post signed paperwork to their accountant and lawyer,\n- courier brochure artwork proofs to their printer,\n- and send the odd parcel.\n\nConversely, a handmade candle business manages things like sending a letter to their accountant here. And _all_ of their candle shipping in [[20-29]]. They do things like:\n\n- buy pre-paid parcel satchels and packing materials in bulk,\n- and print address labels and other collateral material that goes in the parcels.\n\nAnd a handmade furniture business manages things like sending a letter to their lawyer here. And _all_ of their furniture shipping in [[20-29]]. They do things like:\n\n- deal with domestic air and land freight companies,\n- and organise international container shipping and export paperwork."
