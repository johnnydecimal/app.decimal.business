      "moreInfo": "This ID is for storing copies of any licence, permit, or accreditation that your business cannot trade without. First, you registered your business. Now you need the legal proof that you can provide a product or service.\n\nThis ‘proof’ will vary considerably depending on what you do. If you run a bar, you’ll need a liquor licence. If you’re a healthcare provider in private practice, you must have a degree, as well as any other required accreditations.\n\nYou might be thinking, “hey Johnny.Decimal, you’ve always said not to have copies of things in different places”. Absolutely – for documents that change, like a budget spreadsheet. You should never have multiple copies of things like that because someone will inevitably update the wrong version.\n\nHowever, licences, permits, and accreditations are static documents. Probably a PDF or a piece of paper. It’s okay to put copies of them where it’s helpful and makes sense to do so. They’re not going to change unless they are renewed.\n\nThis is an important ID to keep up-to-date in your JDex and to set reminders for to ensure nothing expires.",
