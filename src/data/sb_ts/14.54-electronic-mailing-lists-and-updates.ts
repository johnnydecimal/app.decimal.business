      "examples": "Whether you use a third-party service or manage this yourself, you might record things like: dates to send newsletters and other updates; the process for developing, reviewing, and approving content; where the logins are in your password manager; who the admins are and what permissions other users have; preferred templates, image sizes, and other specifications; links to the master creative files; troubleshooting tips; and anything else that’s important.",
      "overview": "Similar to [[14.53]], this is a place to store any details related to the set up and ongoing management of updates that you control. Things like email newsletters and SMS updates. It’s about the underlying _administration_ of the account and mailing list. Not what you send out.\n\nThink about it from the perspective of a new staff member that you’ve asked to look after your mailing list and updates. What are all the little details they need to know?\n\nWe also recommend recording any configuration or behind-the-scenes settings. For example, depending on the platform, certain tracking options may be enabled by default. If you edit these, leave notes here.",
      "exceptions": "This is not where you manage your actual email account, that’s up in [[14.32]] and [[14.41]].\n\nThis is not where you produce and store the content you send out, that happens in [[80-89]] and [[90-99]].\n\nIf you do printed mail-outs, manage the mailing lists in [[XX-XX]], and the content development in [[80-89]] and [[90-99]].",
      "alsoSee": "Any services related to managing newsletters and updates are noted in [[14.32]].\n\nKeep in mind any applicable privacy and data protection laws when dealing with mailing lists, as noted in [[11.13]] and [[14.22]].",
      "links": "The GDPR is the [EU’s data protection law](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) – if you hold data from EU citizens, then you’ll need to read up on this.\n\nA genuine endorsement – if you’re looking to set up a newsletter for your business, check out [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/), a nice service run by nice humans."
