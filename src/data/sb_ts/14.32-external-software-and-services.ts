      "overview": "This is a place to record anything to do with third-party software, apps, and services for any computer or device. All the things that you have bought outright, or downloaded, or that you subscribe to for ongoing access.\n\nMost of us will just have ‘commercial off-the-shelf’ software. But if you’ve paid to have something custom-made, note that here too. And if you’ve downloaded things like fonts and wallpapers, those can also live here.\n\nRemember to record any settings/configuration. For example, if you use a third-party email service, you might note settings you’ve turned on or off, any filtering rules applied, and standard wording for staff signatures and out-of-office replies.\n\nWe made this ID so that there is space to save things _if you need to_. If you don’t have anything to save, that’s fine. If all you have is an account login, store it securely in your password manager and note its existence in [[14.41]].",
      "exceptions": "This is not a place to save account logins – note their existence in [[14.41]] and store the logins securely in your password manager\\*.\n\nThis is not a place to manage ‘real-world’ subscriptions and orders (e.g. fruit box, printer toner, or toilet paper deliveries) – those go up in [[12.20]] or [[12.30]].\n\n\\*Don’t have a password manager? Please stop reading this right now, and go and get a reputable one that you can use on all your business computers and devices. We use and recommend 1Password.",
      "alsoSee": "Add any technology subscriptions from here to the master list at [[13.35]] so you can track all of your recurring outgoings."
