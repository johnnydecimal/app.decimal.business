      "moreInfo": "It’s important to identify events that can negatively impact your business. And then plan how to make decisions and operate during the event, and recover afterwards (often referred to as ‘business continuity and disaster recovery’). Your future self will thank you for having a process in place if disaster strikes.\n\nA business risk might be specific to your product or service. While emergencies might be location-specific natural disasters, human-caused events like crime, or municipal events like a water main rupturing.\n\nFor example, if you sell croissants, your risk management plan might include what to do if the price of butter rises. If your business is next to a river, your emergency management plan might include flood evacuation procedures.\n\nEither way, don’t forget to securely store contact numbers for local emergency, police, fire, and ambulance services, as well as recovery contacts for things like insurance, banking, and suppliers.\n\n### Emergency digital recovery kit\n\nAnother risk you might consider here is – what if something happens to you? Who do you trust the most to log in to things, pay bills, and contact people on your behalf?\n\nIn our [Life Admin System](https://jdcm.al/14.11/), we discuss the concept of an emergency recovery kit. Which is basically just a list of instructions, stored in a secure location, that outlines your digital life for a trusted person in an emergency. In this case, it’s for your business.\n\nThis will obviously contain sensitive information, so don’t leave it lying around! There’s a good chance that your password manager can help you manage this kind of thing securely.",
