We also recommend keeping notes on how you deal with this stuff.\n\nIf this ID starts to get busy, consider using the extend-the-end method with the ‘+’ to nest sub-IDs under the parent ID.\n\n**Do not store passwords here.**\n\nThe actual logins (i.e. usernames and passwords) should be in a reputable password manager. Or something else that’s encrypted. Never store your passwords in a plain text file. Ask us if you need help with password management.",
