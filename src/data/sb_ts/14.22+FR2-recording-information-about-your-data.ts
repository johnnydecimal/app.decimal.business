In our case, Johnny has an Airtable database of all our drives, what's on them, and how they’re backed up. It's handy to be able to see how many copies of a thing we have.\n\nAnd remember that not everything is on a computer. You might have important data in the physical world. For example, ledgers, cash books, desk diaries, or filing cabinets. If you’re a wedding celebrant, this includes your register.\n\nWe also recommend noting how important your data is (i.e. what classifies as a disaster if it’s lost and what is less important).\n\nIf there’s demand, we could develop a database template like Johnny’s for everyone to use."
