      "overview": "This is a place to note any non-physical items you own that are involved in running the business or contribute to its future worth.\n\nThese type of assets are classified as ‘intangible’ because you can’t physically touch them.\\* Depending on what they are, intangible assets might be much more valuable than any fixed or current assets.\n\n### Saving files\n\nThis ID should contain copies of records saved elsewhere in the system. That’s okay because these are static records. We want a place where you and/or your accountant can go to see the proof of ownership and value of any intangible assets in one place.\n\nFor instance, a scientist’s R&D and patent are intangible assets. She manages these in [[20-29]]. She copies the key records here for her accountant. And she also has a master finance record in [[13.11]] that includes a summary of her intangible assets because that’s how she rolls.\n\n\\*For the pedants, in the case of, say, a licence or permit, we’re talking about the concept of the thing here, not a printout of it."
