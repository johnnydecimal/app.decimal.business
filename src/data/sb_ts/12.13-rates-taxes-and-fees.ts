      "overview": "This is a place for managing any fees that you can’t get out of. They might be imposed by the government. Or perhaps by an organisation that manages shared premises, such as a shopping centre, office block, or industrial estate.\n\nWhether leasing or buying a property, ensure you’re clear on what mandatory one-off and ongoing fees you’ll need to account for in your running costs. For instance, there can be extra fees associated with commercial and retail leases versus residential leases.\n\nAnd watch out for unscrupulous landlords asking for illegal fees. We recently learned about the practice of asking for ‘key money’ when signing retail leases. This is prohibited in Australia and might also be wherever you are.",
