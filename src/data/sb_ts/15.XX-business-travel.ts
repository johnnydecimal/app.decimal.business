      "overview": "This is a place to organise any sort of (probably) longer-distance, business-related travel that isn’t day-to-day operations.\n\nThings like attending meetings, conferences, and expos, or any event where you represent the business.\n\nOr perhaps you need to travel to complete a project. For instance, a photographer who travels overseas to do a photoshoot. Or a tradesperson who travels interstate to complete a construction contract.\n\nWhether it’s short term or longer, at the bare minimum you need to get there.\n\nYou might need to catch a plane to attend a meeting in another city, but just for the day. Store the plane tickets and any expenses here. If you end up having to stay overnight, record your accommodation details too. If the next meeting is overseas, you might also need visas, vaccinations, and other documents.\n\nThat’s why we created a work trip template, so everything stays neat and tidy:\n\n- 10 Planning\n- 20 Travel documents & visas ← specific to the trip\n- 30 Transport\n- 40 Accommodation\n- 50 Itineraries & schedules\n- 60 Expenses to claim",
