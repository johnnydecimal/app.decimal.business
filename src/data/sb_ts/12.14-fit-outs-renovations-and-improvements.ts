As such, we recommend that any equipment ordered as part of the project be stored in those sections.\n\nThis ID might be empty for many businesses. Like us. Our office is a room in a rented house. We will never be renovating it. However, it will be very busy for others. The hair salon above is based on a friend who spent a hectic 6 months fitting out a new space.",
