      "overview": "Similar to [[14.52]], this is a place to store any details related to the set up and ongoing management of social media accounts that you control. It’s about the underlying _administration_ of a social media account. Not what’s on it.\n\nThink about it from the perspective of a new staff member that you’ve asked to look after your social media. What are all the little details they need to know?\n\nWe also recommend recording any configuration or behind-the-scenes settings. Especially stuff related to privacy and security, commenting, and direct messaging. We’re not social media experts.\\* But we’ve noticed that there’s _a lot_ of settings these days, so keep an eye on them.\n\nIf you decide to close an account and download your data, you could store that here too.\n\n\\*If you _are_ an expert, it would be great to see you in this [[community]] thread.",
