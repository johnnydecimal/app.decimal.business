It's where you can do rough work without anyone having to see it.\n\nIt contains an inbox where asset records are held until you process and permanently file them in either:\n\n- [[13.43]],\n- [[13.44]],\n- [[13.45]],\n- [[13.46]].\n\nAnd if you need to do any messy calculations as you process the assets, there’s room here.",
      "rationale": "The goal of the five ‘inbox and processing’ IDs in this category is to add a little rigour to ensure you don’t miss anything. Income payments and tax deductible expenses are like treasure. And forgetting to pay other people is bad form.\n\nWe don’t want to accidentally overlook these things because we’re busy keeping our customers happy. So hopefully these ops manuals will help form good habits around cross-checking incomings and outgoings."
