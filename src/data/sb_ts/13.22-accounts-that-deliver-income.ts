      "overview": "This is a place for any accounts whose primary function is _delivering_ money to you.\n\nThis might sound strange, but it’s increasingly common for many businesses. For instance, the accounts that online payment processors or sales channels deliver earnings through. Or maybe you have a bank account that is only for deposits. Store those formal statements here too.\n\nWe recommend using the year-month method when saving paperwork and statements so everything sorts neatly. And subfolder by account issuer.",
