These lists have probably been developed over time, are specific to your work, and you don’t want to lose them.\n\nMaybe you want to store a copy outside of your browser bookmarks for reasons. Or perhaps you want to share them with others. For example, when onboarding new staff you might provide a list of resources like:\n\n- industry newsletters to sign up for,\n- trusted websites for research and reading,\n- blogs and RSS feeds to follow; communities to join,\n- YouTube or social media accounts to follow,\n- or trade journals to review.\n\nNote that this is a ‘special-case’ ID that happens to be in the technology library. Organise the rest of this library as you wish.\n\n## Exceptions\n\n## Also see\n\n\n## Links\n\n# Description",
