It's where you can do rough work without anyone having to see it.\n\nIt contains an inbox where asset records are held until you process and permanently file them in either:\n\n- [[13.43]],\n- [[13.44]],\n- [[13.45]],\n- [[13.46]].\n\nAnd if you need to do any messy calculations as you process the assets, thereâ€™s room here.",
