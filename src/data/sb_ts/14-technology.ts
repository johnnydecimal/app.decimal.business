Like hardware and software, setting up your online presence, and staying safe in cyberspace.\n\nAnd to be an honorary IT professional, this includes notes about configuration (i.e. all the stuff you did when you set something up). This is a nice example of â€˜working the Decimal wayâ€™ â€“ keeping notes to help your future self. It might be as simple as bullet points in your JDex or maybe a diagram, depending on what youâ€™re documenting. Now youâ€™ll never forget what you did.",

Not for any â€˜computerised machinesâ€™ that are specific to your operations or product, those go in [[12.20]], [[12.30]], or [[20-29]].\n\nThis category is for managing _your_ technology. If your product or service is related (e.g. youâ€™re an IT consultant or run a computer repair shop) that goes in [[20-29]].\n\nThis category is not for managing technology related to workplace security or access (e.g cameras, passcards), that goes in [[12.22]] or [[12.32]]."
