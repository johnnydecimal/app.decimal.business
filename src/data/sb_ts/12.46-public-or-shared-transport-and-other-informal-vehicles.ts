      "overview": "This is a place to manage anything to do with using public or shared transport, or owning informal vehicles.\n\nBy ‘informal’ we mean the vehicle probably doesn’t need official paperwork like registrations, inspections, or mandatory insurance. Who knows what other kinds of vehicle are part of your business. If it can be pedalled, stood on, sat on, or pulled along, put it here.\n\nThese type of vehicles may or may not have their own insurance. They might be covered under a policy for your home office or other fixed-location premises. If not, store the details here and note it in your JDex.\n\nIf you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or unique identifier. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly."
