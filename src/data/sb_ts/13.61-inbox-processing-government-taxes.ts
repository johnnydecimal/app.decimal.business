It's where you can do rough work without anyone having to see it.\n\nIt contains an inbox where government tax records are held until you process and permanently file them in [[13.62]].\n\nAnd if you need to do any messy calculations as you process government taxes, there’s room here.",
      "rationale": "The goal of the five ‘inbox and processing’ IDs in this category is to add a little rigour to ensure you don’t miss anything. Income payments and tax deductible expenses are like treasure. And forgetting to pay other people is bad form – especially the government.\n\nWe don’t want to accidentally overlook these things because we’re busy keeping our customers happy. So hopefully these ops manuals will help form good habits around cross-checking incomings and outgoings. And ensuring our data is shipshape for tax time.",
