We appreciate that there’ll be some grey areas here depending on what you do. And we don’t want things to get confusing.\n\nFor example, if you run a sheep property or dairy farm and sell the wool/milk, it would probably be impractical to classify these animals as staff.\n\nBut if you run, say, a Hansom cab or sled dog tourism business, you might classify the horses or dogs as staff and manage them here. But the thing you’re selling is the _experience_ of riding around New York’s Central Park or a snowscape in northern Canada, which is managed in [[20-29]]."
