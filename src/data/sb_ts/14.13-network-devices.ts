They're important enough to have their own ID because without network we usually can't get anything done.\n\nThis is a place to store important documents that come with the device, such as manuals, warranties, and duplicates of purchase and repair receipts (from [[13.33]]). And if you decide to sell anything, manage that here too.\n\nThis is also a place to keep any troubleshooting notes that you’ve written and settings/configuration you’ve applied. This comes in handy when you need to replace your network device or set up new devices for staff.\n\nWe recommend naming subfolders by purchase date and model.",
      "alsoSee": "If you sell a high-value network device, record the details in [[13.26]] after processing the income.\n\nIf you purchase a high-value network device, record the details in [[13.44]] after processing the asset.\n\nIf you’re paying off a network device, process the bills in [[13.30]] or [[13.50]].\n\nSee [[14.31]] for the overall service that a network device contributes to (e.g. user login, internet connectivity, wifi connectivity, printing, file services)."
