If you’re not sure what you might research and plan in this ID, here’s some questions to get started:\n\n- Is my business idea viable?,\n- What are my start-up and ongoing operating budgets?,\n- What taxes apply to me? (e.g. income, sales, fringe benefits, capital gains, payroll, land, stamp duty),\n- What are my financial goals and some strategies to reach them?,\n- Will I use digital tools and accounting, time-tracking, or payroll software?,\n- Will I rely on a bookkeeper or accountant or do as much as I can myself?,\n- What kind of bank account/s do I need?,\n- How will I deal with cash? (e.g. currency conversions, cash floats, petty cash, cash books),\n- Do I need help protecting profits? (e.g. diversifying investments to reduce risk)."
