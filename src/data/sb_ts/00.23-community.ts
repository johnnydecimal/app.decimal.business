This is the same problem you face with your file system: there are any number of ways to refer to the same concept. Confusion results from the ambiguity.\n\nOur system defines a language. When we're talking about payroll, that's _always_ [13.34 Payroll](/13.34).<sup>1</sup> So now you can ask for help in a really specific place.\n\nWe have two communities, [Discord and the forum](/00.13). Both will have dedicated small business sections whose structure mirrors the system.\n\nSo you won't find yourself asking for payroll help in a channel full of people talking about their tax returns. We'll keep everything in the right channel. **Jump in, get targeted help, and get back to work**.\n\n> 1. If you searched for `payroll` on the previous page, do you now find yourself remembering the number? :-)"

Lucy and I will be constantly monitoring our communities, and feeding information that should be persistent back in to the system.\n\nIf it's useful, it'll become permanent. You shouldn't have to worry about searching a forum for information. We'll do that for you."
