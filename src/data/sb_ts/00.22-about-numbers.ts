The page you're reading is an ID: its number is `00.22`.\n\nThe number tells you where this thing is. This one's in category `00`. Where's category `00`? It's in area `00-09`. You can see this structure in the links above.\n\nThis structure is mirrored on your computer. Guess how you organise your files?\n\n<picture id=\"FinderImage\">\n  <source\n    media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\"\n    srcset=\"/img/00.93A-Finder-light-792x294.png\"\n  />\n  <source\n    media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\"\n    srcset=\"/img/00.93A-Finder-dark-792x294.png\"\n  />\n  <img\n    alt=\"A screenshot of the macOS finder showing a simple hierarchy. Folder '10-19 Company admin' contains folder '13 Money earned, spent, saved, & owed', which in turn contains folder '13.34 Payroll'.\"\n    id=\"finder\"\n    src=\"/img/00.93A-Finder-light-792x294.png\"\n    width=\"396\"\n    height=\"147\"\n  />\n</picture>\n\nThis makes it really hard to lose stuff.\n\nYou don't even have to create these folders yourself. You'll download the complete structure from this site."

No more trying to explain to someone which one of your 'finance' folders they have to try to find.\n\nOr you could stick a number to the side of that piece of machinery that always breaks down. Now anybody immediately knows where to look for the service contract."
