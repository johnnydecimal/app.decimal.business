But we wanted to leave space for other types of ‘one-way’ accounts that bring money in because they’re becoming more common.\n\nWhether you sell things online or in person, these services process payments, collect earnings, and then transfer them to your designated bank account. They are important because they handle income. If you get audited and forget to mention them, the tax man might have something to say about that.\n\nAs per the Johnny.Decimal rule, if it logically fits higher up in the system, put it in the first place that makes sense. So that’s why we recommend differentiating these accounts and storing their paperwork and statements up here."
