We don’t know what kind of miscellaneous paperwork is issued to businesses around the world. So we wanted to leave space just in case.\n\nRemember to leave a note in your JDex when you save things in this ID so you can find them easily.\n\nThis is an important habit to get into, by the way. Don’t agonise if you’re unsure where something should go. Find the first relevant ID, make a decision, and leave yourself a note. Having a well-maintained JDex means you’ll never lose anything again.",
