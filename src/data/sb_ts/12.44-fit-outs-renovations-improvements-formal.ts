      "overview": "This is a place to manage larger projects, specific to vehicles, that have an end. And once done, you move into front or back office operations mode.\n\nAs such, we recommend that any equipment ordered as part of the project be stored in [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].\n\nIf you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or registration. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.",
      "exceptions": "Repairs, maintenance, and associated purchases go in [[12.45]].\n\nFront or back office equipment ordered as part of a project goes in [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].",
      "rationale": "As mentioned in [[12.14]], we made a decision that these type of projects are about building and/or installing things that are designed for a specific vehicle – and they might not have an ops manual.\n\nWhereas front or back office equipment ordered as part of the project might have service contracts, or staff training and cleaning manuals linked to them, so they belong in operations. For instance, a coffee cart’s espresso machine or till."
