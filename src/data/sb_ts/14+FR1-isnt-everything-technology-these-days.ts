      "text": "We have so many gadgets now, so there’s a lot of potential crossover between general technology, operations, and product. But we made a decision that this category is for classic computers, mobile devices, accessories, and other digital services that are common to _most_ businesses. The things that underpin everything else. And that you probably have more control over.\n\nAnd it’s _not_ for computerised machines that are specific to your operations or product. Anything from card readers and payment machines, medical devices, manufacturing equipment, or that fancy robot vacuum cleaner in the back office.\n\nThink about it like this. If you decide to open a completely different business, the gadgets you use in daily operations will change. But your over-arching IT setup probably won’t.\n\n## Here’s a scenario\n\nA gift shop has a card reader at the till (which is really just a paid service that happens to come with a gadget). The card reader needs a computer or iPad, network, and wifi to run – these are managed here. And the card reader and its subscription go in [[12.34]] and [[14.32]], respectively.\n\nSame goes for our dentist. Their x-ray machine sends scans to a computer in the treatment room via the network. Whether they own or lease this machine, they’ll be paying someone to ensure it is mechanically sound and the software is updated. As above, the computers and network are managed here. And the x-ray machine and its support contract go in [[12.34]] and [[14.33]], respectively.\n\nIf our dentist decided to convert the surgery into a gift shop, they can still use their existing computers, mobile devices, and network gear. But instead of an x-ray machine, they’ll be running a card reader and till.\n\nSee [[14.14#When is an accessory ‘technology’ versus ‘front office operations’?]] for further rationale on this decision."
