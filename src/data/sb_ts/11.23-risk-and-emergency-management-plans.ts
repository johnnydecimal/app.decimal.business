      "overview": "It’s important to identify events that can negatively impact your business. And then plan how to make decisions and operate during the event, and recover afterwards (often referred to as ‘business continuity and disaster recovery’). Your future self will thank you for having a process in place if disaster strikes.\n\nA business risk might be specific to your product or service. While emergencies might be location-specific natural disasters, human-caused events like crime, or municipal events like a water main rupturing.\n\nFor example, if you sell croissants, your risk management plan might include what to do if the price of butter rises. If your business is next to a river, your emergency management plan might include flood evacuation procedures.\n\nEither way, don’t forget to securely store contact numbers for local emergency, police, fire, and ambulance services, as well as recovery contacts for things like insurance, banking, and suppliers.",
