      "overview": "Payroll is serious stuff. Depending on where you are in the world, there are strict governance and compliance obligations to meet. And harsh penalties if you don’t. No matter how nice your business is, realistically, your staff are here for the money. So payroll must go seamlessly every single cycle.\n\nTherefore, we can’t advise you how to do it.<sup>1</sup> It’s beyond our scope. We recommend outsourcing the process to an accountant or bookkeeper who specialises in payroll, and/or using payroll software. But we _do_ think that payroll lives over here with the money and numbers. It’s just an expense.\n\n> 1. Perhaps one day, after community discussion with experienced business owners and accountants/bookkeepers, we can develop an ops manual that covers payroll basics.",
