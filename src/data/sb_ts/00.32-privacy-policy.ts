      "overview": "I go to great lengths to protect my own privacy. I use an [independent search engine](https://kagi.com), an [independent, Swiss-based email service](https://migadu.com), a [network-level DNS filter](https://nextdns.io), a [local ad blocker](https://1blocker.com), and the [most privacy-preserving VPN on the planet](https://mullvad.net). I pay money for all of these services (yes, I pay for my search engine).\n\nI tell you this so that you believe me when I say that **I care about your privacy as much as you do**. These aren't just some words that I'm saying to placate you. I mean it.\n\nThe simplest way for me to care about your privacy is to collect as little of your personal data as possible. Here's how.\n\n#### Making a purchase\n\nWhen you make a purchase, you enter your email address, name, street address, and credit card details on my Shopify store.\n\nShopify needs these details to validate your card purchase and prevent fraud.\n\nI can see your email address, name, and street address. But I'll never use them without your permission.\n\nFor example, I don't sign you up to my mailing list unless you check that box. Perhaps making me the only online store in the world where that button _actually does something_. ðŸ˜¡\n\nI can only see the last 4 digits of your credit card number.\n\n#### Your details on this site\n\nAs of the time of writing, I can see the values that you store in your [user settings](/01). For example, the name of your Obsidian vault, if you specify one.\n\nThey're in a dashboard at [Clerk](https://clerk.com), the service I use for authentication. I'd have to go looking for them to see them. I won't, unless you specifically ask for support that requires me to do so.\n\nI'd really like to encrypt these settings one day, but doing so isn't trivial. Given the nature of the data, it's not high on my list.\n\n#### Web analytics\n\nPeople conflate 'analytics' with 'trackers', which is a shame. But the industry dug that hole for themselves, so here we are.\n\n'Analytics' tells me, at a very high level, how many people visit this site, and which pages they view. This helps me spot broad patterns.\n\nI use the open source [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) for this. It doesn't track _you_ in any way. So it isn't recording that _you_ visited this page or that page. It just records that _somebody_ did.\n\nMany ad blockers will block these requests out of the box. If you'd like to do it explicitly, block `jdcmal.goatcounter.com`.\n\n(By the way, this has been possible since the first web server. _Every_ server will show you a log of the requests it's served, and that's essentially all that this is.)\n\n#### Cookies\n\n[Clerk](https://clerk.com), the service I use for authentication, uses cookies to track your user session, i.e. if you are logged in or not.\n\n#### Contact me\n\nIf you have [any concerns at all](mailto:hello@johnnydecimal.com).\n\nI've been on the internet since 1994. I remember it when it wasn't full of sleaze and junk. I'm doing my best to be a good citizen."
