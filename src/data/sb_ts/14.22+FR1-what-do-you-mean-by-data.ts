      "text": "If the word ‘data’ gives you hives, don’t stress. It’s just a nerdy way to say ‘stuff’.\n\nIt might help to think about it as ‘blocks of stuff’. For instance, Johnny’s laptop home folder is one block that he cares about. The files for the Johnny.Decimal business (D85) is another block that lives elsewhere.\n\nEach block is treated differently. D85 is precious so it’s stored in more places and backed up constantly. It’s also very large. So we don’t keep complete copies of it on our laptops, just the files we need. But the backups have _everything_.\n\nAnother example is Lucy’s design files that live in the Procreate app on her iPad. It wouldn’t be a disaster if they were lost, just annoying. So these are exported and backed up to our server less frequently.\n\n## Customer data\n\nNote that we have not differentiated here between your data and your customers’ data. It’s too difficult. If you’re storing something you’re responsible for treating it carefully, regardless of the source. If you _do_ hold customer data, then you’ll need to be aware of applicable laws and regulations, as mentioned above."
