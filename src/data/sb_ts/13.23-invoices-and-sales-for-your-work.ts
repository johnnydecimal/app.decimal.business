This includes long-term income for things like royalties and book sales. You did the work once and continue to get paid for it.\n\nAnd if you have to deal with bad debts, we recommend noting those here too. They’re still sales, you just didn’t receive the money.\n\n\\*Your accountant might refer to this as ‘accounts receivable’."
