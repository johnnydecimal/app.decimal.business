      "overview": "This is the place to store all formal paperwork and statements for accounts that are used to both receive income and pay expenses.\n\nFor most small businesses this will be a traditional bank account – probably your main account. But it might also include other types of specialised account, platform, or app.\n\nNote that in Australia and potentially other countries, companies, partnerships, and trusts must have a business account for tax purposes. Sole traders can use a personal account, but a business account is still recommended. So if you’re just starting out, spend a little time figuring out what kind of account is best for you.\n\nAnd if you’re a cyborg from the future and only deal with digital currency, then store those records here too.\n\n### What do you mean by ‘formal’ statements and paperwork?\n\nStatic documents supplied by a platform or bank (e.g. PDFs). As opposed to raw data that you might download into a spreadsheet and manipulate. Do that kind of work in [[13.21]] or [[13.31]].\n\n### Saving files\n\nWe recommend using the year-month method when saving paperwork and statements so everything sorts neatly. And subfolder by account issuer."
