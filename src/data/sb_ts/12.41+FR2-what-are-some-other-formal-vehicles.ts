A flight training school will have a plane or a helicopter. A tree surgeon will have a cherry picker. We know someone whose agricultural business uses drones that must be registered with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.\n\nThen there’s things that can be towed and require a registration to travel on roads. Such as trailers used by gardeners, and converted caravans for food or coffee service.\n\nAnd of course there’ll be grey areas. Maybe you have a hot air balloon business. Not a traditional motor vehicle, but they need to be certified and transported on a registered trailer. So they go here.\n\nWhat if you have an unregistered tractor that never leaves your farm? You’ll have proof of ownership documents and you might register it _someday_. So it goes here.\n\nHere’s another niche, but relevant, example. What if you run a Hansom cab (horse and carriage) business? The carriage isn’t a traditional motor vehicle. But it carries passengers, often in busy cities. You’ll no doubt have registrations, inspections, and other paperwork for this vehicle. So it goes here. And your horses fit nicely in [[11.45]]."
