      "overview": "These examples are car focused for simplicity. But if you have different types of vehicles, adapt as needed. For instance, you might have to pay marina or airport fees for a boat or plane that are equivalent to car parking.\n\nRunning expenses are the everyday transactions related to your vehicles like buying fuel or going to the car wash. Contrast with repairs and maintenance, which are less frequent transactions and are managed separately below.\n\nDepending on your business, this might be a busy ID if you have a lot of running expenses. But as long as you process the receipts in your inbox regularly and archive them neatly, you’ll stay on top of what you’re spending.\n\nIf you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or registration. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.",
      "exceptions": "Repairs, maintenance, and associated purchases go in [[12.45]].\n\nFuel tax credits or other government grants go in [[13.25]].\n\nFines and penalties go in [[13.55]]."
