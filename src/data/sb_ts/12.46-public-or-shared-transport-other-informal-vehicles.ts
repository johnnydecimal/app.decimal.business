If it can be pedalled, stood on, sat on, or pulled along, put it here. \n\nThese type of vehicles may or may not have their own insurance. Perhaps they’re covered under a policy related to your home office or other fixed-location premises. If not, store the details here and note it in your JDex.\n\nIf you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or unique identifier. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly."
