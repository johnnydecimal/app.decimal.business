It‚Äôs about the underlying _administration_ of your online presence.\n\nIt‚Äôs _not_ the words, images, or videos that you publish. Anything that you add to a website, blog, or social media account is a creative job. Any email newsletter you send is a creative job. And that is managed in your creative inputs and outputs categories.",
