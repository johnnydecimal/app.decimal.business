For instance, a built-in shelf.\n\nWhereas back or front office _equipment_ ordered as part of a project might have service contracts, or staff training and cleaning manuals, so that belongs in operations. For instance, the hair salon’s espresso machine in the kitchen area and massage chairs by the sinks."
