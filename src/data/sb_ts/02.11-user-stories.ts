We have an entire category dedicated to [shipping & fulfilment](/35) but if you're a hairdresser, that's not something you ever do. And that's okay.\n\nThis is intended to encourage you to think about your own business. You probably shouldn't just copy one of these examples. If you need help, we're always available. Just ask. Maybe we can tell your story?\n\n#### Quadrant chart\n\nWe've divided all businesses up in to four quadrants.\n\nOn one extreme you **produce** a thing, and on the other you **deliver** a service. And the thing you produce or deliver might be **tangible** or **intangible**.\n\nWe can plot this on a quadrant chart."
