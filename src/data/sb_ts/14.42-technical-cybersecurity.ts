      "overview": "It’s imperative to have measures in place to protect your data and your customers’ data. There’s too many heartbreaking stories of people losing everything from scams, hackers, phishing, malware, viruses, and other threats.\n\nSo if you’ve been putting this off, it’s time to stop procrastinating – the bad guys aren’t. The good news is, there’s a lot of great information and help available now.\n\nThis is a place to keep anything related to the ‘technical’ aspects of managing your cybersecurity. What is your overall plan? Is it active now or do you need to organise some professional advice? Does your type of business have a higher risk profile than others? And what are the devices and software that you’ll rely on?",
      "exceptions": "This is for your overall cybersecurity plan – the devices or software involved are managed elsewhere (e.g. a firewall lives in [[14.13]], antivirus software lives in [[14.32]]).",
