      "text": "It’s hard to know how every business interacts with their suppliers. But we designed this ID to be a master reference that is kept separate from daily operations.\n\nThis might be useful for shared workplaces or when new staff join, so people can easily find background information. Or if different staff deal with different areas of the business (e.g. daily operations versus the product) so you don’t have the same files open.\n\nThink of it as a place that is more ‘static’ versus the incoming and outgoing orders, confirmations, invoices, and receipts that you deal with day to day.\n\nAnd these might be the kind of suppliers that many businesses share, like tradespeople, cleaners, and mechanics. Whereas suppliers that contribute directly to your product are specific to you.\n\nHere’s some examples of general suppliers for basic operations.\n\n**Building and maintenance** – real estate agent; tradespeople; insurance broker.\n\n**Office and operations** – utilities; cleaning and bathroom services; couriers and postal services; security; waste removal; stationery and other office equipment; tea/coffee and other kitchen supplies.\n\n**Vehicles** – mechanics; tyres, accessories, and spare parts retailers; panel beating and body repairs; painting and sign writing; custom alterations."
