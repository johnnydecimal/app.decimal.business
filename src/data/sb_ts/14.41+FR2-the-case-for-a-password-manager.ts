      "text": "There’s no excuse these days for not having one.\n\nYou don’t want everything out in the open. What if you get hacked? What if a staff member goes rogue and gets your banking login? Similarly, have you checked around the office or vehicles for logins taped to computers? We know they’re there. Find them and put them in a password manager.\n\nPassword managers make your digital life much more secure, and also less frustrating by speeding up the login process. They’re inexpensive. Just get one.\n\nThe main consideration is probably whether it’s just for you, or if you have staff that need to use it. And if so, should different staff members have different levels of access to what’s inside.\n\nIn this case, look for password managers that make it easy to compartmentalise and share information. They’ll have things like ‘vaults’ that you can populate with specific details. For example, only the person who does the banking and accounts should be able to see the banking and accounting software logins.\n\nJust search for ‘password managers for business’ and you’ll get a bunch of hits. At JDHQ we use 1Password across all our computers and mobile devices."
