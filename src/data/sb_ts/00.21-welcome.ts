Thousands of people have used it to organise their lives for over a decade. It's simple, and it works.\n\nBut you don't have time to figure out how to implement this. And why should every small business have to figure it out for themselves? That makes no sense. **Isn't it time we had a standard framework that you could all use?**\n\nThat's what we're building. A standard system that gives you a place for everything. Personally supported by us, and backed up by the community. All you have to do is move in."

For example, [11.12](/11.12) is where you save your [licences, permits, & accreditations](/11.12). If you check out that ID you'll see that we explain what it's for, give some examples, and refer to other relevant IDs.\n\nWe have IDs for [business insurance and claims](/11.22), [dispute resolution](/11.33), [hiring staff](/11.41), and many more.\n\nTo explore the rest, just click around. [10-19](/10-19) is a good place to start. There's a list of all unlocked IDs at [00.00](/00.00)."

It costs [US$150 a year](https://store.johnnydecimal.com/cart/43069054648456:1).<sup>3</sup>\n\nThese are pre-sale prices. They will increase when we launch the system. See [00.01 Sign up](/00.01) for more details.\n\nThis is what me and my partner Lucy do full-time: we quit our jobs to do this. Your membership supports two humans who hand-craft everything you see. The system is the result of thousands of hours of work.\n\nWe're not a faceless corporation. There's no lazy AI-generated slop here. No automated helpdesk. You email me, I help you.\n\nOur plan for the next couple of years is to listen to exactly what you need, and to build it for you as quickly as possible. It'll be like having us on your staff.\n\n> 1. Prices include GST in Australia.\n> 2. Renews one year after the full system is released, not one year after your initial payment.\n> 3. You'll _never_ lose access to your system. If you choose not to renew, you'll just stop getting updates."
