      "overview": "In contrast to [[14.42]], here we’re talking about the ongoing stuff that you and your humans do. This is harder than the technical aspects – that’s set-and-forget. You must be constantly aware of the behavioural side of things.\n\nSo this is a place to plan and manage anything related to behaviours that strengthen your cybersecurity. A written policy on behaviour expectations, research you’ve done, information sheets on different topics for staff, and whatever else you need.",
      "exceptions": "Compliance obligations around things like privacy and data handling go in [[11.13]].\n\nIf you need to write a data retention policy, that lives in [[14.22]].\n\nIf you organise formal cybersecurity training, manage that in [[11.50]] and note who completed it in [[11.42]].",
      "alsoSee": "How you respond to a cybersecurity incident should also be included in [[11.23]].\n\nHaving good policies and behaviours here will help with [[14.44]].\n\n\n# Methods for manually creating a strong password\n\n[Johnny to write]",
