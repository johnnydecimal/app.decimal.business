It's where you can do rough work without anyone having to see it.\n\nIt contains an inbox where income records are held until you process and permanently file them in either:\n\n- [[13.23]],\n- [[13.24]],\n- [[13.25]],\n- [[13.26]].\n\nAnd if you need to do any messy calculations as you process the income, there’s room here.",
