      "overview": "When we say ‘office’, we mean whatever your fixed business premises means to you. Whether you have a room in your house, a commercial warehouse lease, or own a bakery, this is where the insurance for that address goes.\n\nAnd if you store equipment in both a fixed and mobile location, there might be some overlap here. Just do what makes sense to you. For instance, if you’re a plumber your equipment might be insured in your home garage and also in your van. If these are separate policies then save them where relevant.\n\nThis is also a place to save incident reports that might become part of a claim. For example, something is stolen and you file a police report.",
      "exceptions": "If your business ‘premises’ is mobile, like a food truck, van, or trailer, put the insurance details in [[12.42]].\n\nIf you’re a market stall holder or similar, store your equipment in [[12.30]] and your public liability insurance in [[11.22]].\n\nIf you’re a digital nomad with no fixed location, you might cover your valuables under a personal travel insurance policy.",
      "alsoSee": "Having an up-to-date inventory at [[12.0X]] will be helpful if you need to make a claim.\n\nIf you have separate insurance for high-value computers, devices, or accessories, you might decide to store that down in [[14.44]]."
