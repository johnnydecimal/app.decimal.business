We recommend outsourcing the process to an accountant or bookkeeper who specialises in this type of thing.\n\nBut we do think that anything to do with dividends lives over here with all the money and numbers. And it feels logical to put dividends after government taxes since they are paid from post-tax profits.\n\n\\*Perhaps one day, after community discussion with experienced business owners and accountants/bookkeepers, we can develop an ops manual that covers dividend basics."
