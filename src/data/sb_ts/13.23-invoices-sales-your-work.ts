This includes long-term income for things like royalties and book sales. You did the work once and continue to get paid for it.\n\nAnd if you have to deal with bad debts, we recommend noting those here too. They’re still sales, you just didn’t receive the money.\n\n### Where do I create my invoice?\n\nNot everyone uses software to generate invoices. For those who use a template, we recommend saving it here. Export the completed invoice as a PDF to the income inbox and send it. Then process it when it’s paid and move it here for permanent filing.\n\n\\*Your accountant might refer to this as ‘accounts receivable’."
