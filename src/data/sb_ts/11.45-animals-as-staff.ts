      "overview": "Animals play an important role in many businesses, including in tourism, agriculture, search and rescue, pest control, and assistance and companionship. So we didn’t want to forget them. If you need this ID, you know who you are.\n\nWe’re not experts so it’s hard to predict what subfolders might be useful here. It will depend on the animals you have, what they do, and where you live.\n\nIf animals are integral to your business and you need more room, feel free to use the spare IDs in this section. We’d love to know more about this, so come and chat to us in the [[community]]. We’ll help you get the best result, which will help others who need this too.",
      "exceptions": "If you’re a farmer and sell livestock or other animal products such as wool, milk, eggs, or genetic material for breeding, then how you manage all of that should be in [[20-29]] or another area that you create yourself (we can help!)."
