      "overview": "We’re not experts so it’s hard to predict what subfolders you might need. It will depend on the animals you have, what they do, and where you live.\n\nSome basic things to consider include:\n\n- Health records, registrations, and other important documents.\n- Insurance and claims.\n- Nutrition and exercise.\n- Pest control and grooming.\n- Training and discipline.\n- Equipment and shelter.\n- First aid and contacts for general healthcare and medical emergencies.\n\nIf this is integral to your business and you need more room, feel free to use the spare IDs in this section. We’d love it if you chat to us first on the Discord so we can help you get the best result (which will help other people who need this).",
      "exceptions": "If you’re a farmer and sell livestock or other animal products such as wool, milk, eggs, or genetic material for breeding, then how you manage all of that should be in [[20-29]] or another area that you create yourself (or we can help!).",
      "rationale": "This ID was included to accommodate animals in exactly the same way as humans – in the delivery of a business’ product or service. But we appreciate that there’ll be some grey areas here depending on what you do. And we don’t want things to get confusing.\n\nFor instance, if you run a sheep property or dairy farm and sell the wool/milk, it would probably be impractical to classify these animals as staff.\n\nBut if you run, say, a Hansom cab or sled dog tourism business, you might classify the horses and dogs as staff and manage them here. The thing you’re selling is the experience of riding around New York’s Central Park or a snowscape in northern Canada, which is managed elsewhere. As always, do what works for you.\n\nIf you need this ID, you know who you are. If you don’t, it’s highly unlikely you ever will, so just ignore it."
