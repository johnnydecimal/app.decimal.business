As such, we recommend that any equipment ordered as part of the project be stored in [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].\n\nIf you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or registration. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.",
