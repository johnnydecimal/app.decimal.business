      "text": "There’s plenty of advice online about creating strong passwords. But we’d recommend deferring to your trusty password manager to generate them for you.\n\nThere are times when _you_ might need to create a strong, memorable password. For example, the password that unlocks your password manager. You can’t store this in the app, it has to live in your head. **Never ever write that password down.** We will disown you.\n\nWe also recommend having a _verbal_ password that you and your staff can use on the phone to verify your identities. We read an article about a scam where people impersonate business owners, hence the warning.\n\nIt goes like this. A business owner went overseas to a conference. They mentioned specific details in their out-of-office message. A scammer got the message, called the office, and pretended to be the boss. “Hey, Paris is great, quick favour, my card failed, can you transfer $$$ to this other account, thanks, gotta run!”. This is where you say, “sure, what’s the password?” and they hang up."
