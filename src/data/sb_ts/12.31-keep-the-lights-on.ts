But if not, keep the account paperwork and bills here, neatly sorted by year-month.\n\nAnd if you have more than one front office (maybe you have a couple of retail outlets), use per-site subfolders and keep things consistent.\n\nThis would also be a good place to put troubleshooting tips related to a service. For instance, under ‘internet’ save instructions for how to reset the wifi router. Under ‘gas’ save the preferred locations to swap gas bottles.",
