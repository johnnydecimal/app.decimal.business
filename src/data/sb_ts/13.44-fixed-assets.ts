Longer term means for more than one accounting period (i.e. more than 1 year).\n\nThese type of assets are classified as ‘tangible’ because you can physically touch them. And they’re often labelled as ‘property, plant and equipment’ on balance sheets.\n\nSelling this type of asset might be a taxable event so your accountant will want to know about it. They’ll also need to track everything for depreciation purposes. And if you need to deal with repossession of an asset, note that here too."
