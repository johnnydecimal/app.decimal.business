So we made a simple framework to manage finances in. Even if you use accounting software, you still need places to store things and do certain processing tasks.\n\nOur goal is to give you:\n\n- logical buckets to put things in,\n- processes to get your data in shape for your accountant,\n- advice on saving your records neatly.\n\nThere are some accounting terms here. But we didnâ€™t get too technical. If an accountant looked here, we hope theyâ€™d be able to find what they need. Although they might structure and name things differently.",
