It's where you can do rough work without anyone having to see it.\n\nIt contains an inbox where liability records are held until you process and permanently file them in either:\n\n- [[13.52]],\n- [[13.53]],\n- [[13.54]],\n- [[13.55]].\n\nAnd if you need to do any messy calculations as you process the liabilities, thereâ€™s room here.",
