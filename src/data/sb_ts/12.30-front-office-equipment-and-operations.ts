      "overview": "By ‚Äòfront office‚Äô we mean the part of your business premises that is customer facing and supports the delivery of your product or service. But it is _not_ the thing you sell. Some industries call this ‚Äòfront of house‚Äô if that makes it easier to think about.\n\nIt might be an actual office, a retail store, the front of a cafe or bar, or a public space. It‚Äôs wherever you interact with your customers and the equipment or services you use during these interactions.\n\nAnd while many businesses might have a similar back office setup, your front office will be tailored to you."
