By leaving these sections blank, we can introduce everyone to the careful consideration that goes into making a new ID.\n\nIf you’re ready to save things in this library, come over to the [[community]] and see what others are doing. Or ask us for advice. We’ll figure it out together and eventually settle on some standard IDs. In the meantime, just keep things neat and tidy here.\n\n\\*Actually, there’s one ID here – [[14.91]] – this category felt like the right place for it."
