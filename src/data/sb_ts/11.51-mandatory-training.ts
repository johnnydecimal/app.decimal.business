      "moreInfo": "This kind of training has an ‘end’. There’s a list of things to tick off and achieve. \n\nAnd what’s mandatory for some staff may not be for others. Everyone might need to show they can lift a box safely, but only the IT person has to have a particular Microsoft certification.\n\nSome mandatory training will need to be maintained or renewed. For example, demonstrating first aid skills periodically to keep a qualification.",
      "alsoSee": "If the training is core to the business operating legally, add the proof of completion to [[11.12]].\n\nIf the training helps meet compliance obligations, add the proof of completion to [[11.13]].\n\nConsider adding these details to official employee records at [[11.42]].\n\nIf you have preferred in-person or online training suppliers, store their details at [[12.0X)]].\n\nIf the training is based on any ops manuals in [[12.20]] or [[12.30]], ensure any changes are reflected here.",
      "rationale": "We’ve called this ‘mandatory’ as it’s the kind of training you tend to be given as a new employee. Or it might be required due to workplace compliance laws. Or it’s related to how you or staff are expected to do their job. Either way, it must be done."
