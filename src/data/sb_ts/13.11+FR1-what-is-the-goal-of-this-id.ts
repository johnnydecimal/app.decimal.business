If it’s not, it’s a hobby. And that’s not why we’re here.\n\nFor instance, how many customers does a burger truck need every hour to be profitable? When we see local businesses failing, we often worry that too many people aren’t working this out truthfully before they fully commit to an idea.\n\nIf you know what you need to spend each month to meet obligations and then make a profit, you know what you need to earn. Even if you’re a not-for-profit, you’ve still got obligations.\n\nAfter some initial busywork and tedium, you’ll hopefully feel more informed, calm, and in control. Which is the goal of this ID."
