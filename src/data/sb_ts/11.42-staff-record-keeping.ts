Your government may have different requirements.\n\nWe recommend that each employee has a subfolder labelled with the year-month-day they joined (so it sorts neatly) and their name. Inside that is a standard template. We have provided an example template in the folder system. Adjust this to your needs as required, just remember to be consistent.",
