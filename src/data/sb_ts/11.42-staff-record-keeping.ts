Each employee has a subfolder labelled with the year-month-day they joined (so it sorts neatly) and their name. Inside that is a standard template.\n\nWe have provided an example template in the folder system. Adjust this to your needs as required, just remember to be consistent.\n\n2014-07-08 Slydell, Bob\n2017-08-21 Bolton, Michael\n2019-02-14 Lumbergh, Bill\n10 Personal details\n20 Payments and deductions\n30 Work hours and overtime\n40 Leave taken and accrued\n50 Pension contributions\n60 Training completed\n70 Ending the employment\n\nOther records you might consider keeping include: CVs/resumes, job applications and pre-employment checks, employment contracts, performance reviews, trade or registration certificates, details of uniforms and equipment allocated, roles held and promotions.",
