      "overview": "A place for anything you might classify as learning or self-improvement that doesn’t fit elsewhere.\n\nIt’s not related to your business operating legally and/or doesn’t lead to a formal credential. You don’t have to do it, it’s extracurricular. But it might help you be a better business owner or staff member.\n\nFor instance, informal courses, conferences or workshops, coaching programs, webinars, talks, or general reading and media consumption that keeps you informed.\n\nAs an aside, we know some businesses that include budgets for this kind of thing in salary packages. Staff can then spend this on whatever learning they choose. Nice.\n\n**Nerd tip:** this may sound obvious but we only just did it ourselves. Go to your government’s small business and/or tax website and see if they have newsletters. Sign up! We’ve subscribed to about ten different newsletters and so far they’re _full_ of useful stuff.",
