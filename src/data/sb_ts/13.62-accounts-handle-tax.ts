      "overview": "Here we are at the final stop. The big ledger in the sky.\n\nThis is the place to store all the official paperwork and statements related to government tax account/s for the business.\n\nAnd any other important documents related to your quarterly or annual tax returns (including the final tax return itself). Plus any correspondence with your accountant around preparing these returns.\n\n### Saving files\n\nDepending on where you’re from, you might have more than one account for different types of tax. Just subfolder everything neatly using the date and account name, as per previous guidance.",
      "alsoSee": "If you receive a bill for taxes owed, put that in your liabilities inbox at [[13.51]], process it, then file it here.\n\nDitto for your accountant’s invoices for managing your affairs.",
      "rationale": "We recommend that all government tax records should be permanently filed here after processing. Not just income tax returns.\n\nWhether a business is paying income, sales, fringe benefits, or payroll tax, it all goes to an account somewhere with your name on it. So we wanted to ensure there’s a resting place for all the final documents.\n\nHaving everything tax related in the one place feels helpful. You can always duplicate any records that you would like to add elsewhere in the system.",
