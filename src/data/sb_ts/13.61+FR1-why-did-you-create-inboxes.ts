Income payments and tax deductible expenses are like treasure. And forgetting to pay other people is bad form – especially the government.\n\nWe don’t want to accidentally overlook these things because we’re busy keeping our customers happy. So hopefully these ops manuals will help form good habits around cross-checking incomings and outgoings. And ensuring our data is shipshape for tax time."
