      "overview": "This is a place to store proof of ownership documents for any investments the business may have.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- a certificate confirming you own shares,\n- a letter that confirms the conditions for a cash term deposit,\n- a letter that confirms the number of units owned in a managed fund,\n- a title deed for a rental property,\n- a certificate of authenticity for that Caravaggio painting in the boardroom.\n\nThese are probably longer term investments. If they’re short term, your accountant might want to classify them as current assets, but that’s up to them.\n\nAlso, if you have any share trading accounts, this _might_ be a place to store any paperwork for them. Otherwise consider [[13.22]]. In Australia, this could include things like Computershare.",

      "rationale": "### Property as an investment\n\nTo reiterate, we’re not accountants. And when we discussed property ownership, the conversation kept going around in circles.\n\nIf you own your business premises that’s a fixed asset. But a lot of us would think, “hey, isn’t that also an investment?”. And vice versa, if the business owns a rental property as an investment, that’s still a fixed asset right?\n\nWe’re not going to get involved in international balance sheet science. But we _can_ make a decision about folders.\n\nOur recommendation is:\n\n- If you own your business premises, the title deed lives in [[12.11]] and because it’s a fixed asset, copy it to [[13.44]].\n- And if the business also owns a rental property that is _not_ where you trade, we consider that an investment. The rent is your earnings. So the title deed lives here. You could also copy it to [[13.44]] if you prefer.\n\nIf this sounds like madness, we can discuss it in the community. :-)"
