If they’re short term, your accountant might want to classify them as current assets, but that’s up to them.\n\nAlso, if you have any share trading accounts, this _might_ be a place to store any paperwork for them. Otherwise consider [[13.22]]. In Australia, this could include things like Computershare.",
