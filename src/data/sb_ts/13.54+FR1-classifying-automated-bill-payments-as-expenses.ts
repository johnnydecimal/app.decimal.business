      "text": "Normally we think of the bills that we receive by email or post as liabilities. But we made a decision here to classify things like _direct debits_ of bill payments as going ‘straight to expenses’. They’re paid automatically and you don’t need to plan a time to physically transfer money. Those types of liabilities tend to recur predictably, either monthly or quarterly.\n\nFor instance, you’ve set up direct debits for your utility bills. They’re paid automatically on the due date. Now they’re just expense transactions on your bank statement that you process and file in [[13.30]].\n\nCompare this to other bills that arrive unpredictably, that you must pay manually. During one month you receive invoices from a carpenter, a car mechanic, and a new supplier who serviced your front office coffee machine. These are standalone bills for specific jobs and they all have different payment terms.\n\nAs they arrive, put them in the liabilities inbox. Then set aside time later to pay them in order of urgency. The processed invoices are permanently filed here. And you might decide to add copies of them to [[12.14]], [[12.45]], and [[12.34]], respectively."
