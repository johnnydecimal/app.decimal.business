If we do this, we’re not going to lose anything.\n\nIn the example above, we store our card reader in [[12.34]]. In that JDex note, we add a bullet point that says “The iPad that controls this card reader is at [[14.12]]”.\n\nThis advice goes for anything else in your system where there’s a little ambiguity. Links are our friends."
