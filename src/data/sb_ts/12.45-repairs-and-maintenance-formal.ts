For instance, if your ice cream van’s radiator bursts, record the repair details here. But the soft serve machine’s maintenance goes in [[12.34]].\n\nIf you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or registration. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.",
      "exceptions": "Repairing and maintaining equipment that’s in/on the vehicle is part of [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].\n\nThis is not for daily running expenses, put those in [[12.43]]."
