Parts of this system will be very quiet for many businesses and super busy for others.\n\nFor example, Johnny.Decimal HQ operates solely in a rented back office, with two staff, and no vehicles. Most of our business administration is money related, and even then, our accountant does the heavy lifting. When Lucy was a freelance writer, everything happened in her back office – a desk with a laptop. Pretty simple."
