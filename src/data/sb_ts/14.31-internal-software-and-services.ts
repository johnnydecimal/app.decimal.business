      "overview": "By ‘internal software’ we mean any software (fancy or low-code no-code), scripts, or automations you’ve created to help the business. This ID is a place to list anything that you have and where it lives.\n\nBy ‘internal service’ we mean anything you can do on a computer because there’s a combination of devices, software, and/or third-party services working together. This ID is a place to describe how the internal service was set up, for the administrator. And instructions for how to connect to the internal service, for users. Which might just be you wearing two different hats.",
