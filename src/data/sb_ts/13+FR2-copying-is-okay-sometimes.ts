For example, you file the original expense receipt for a computer in [[13.33]], and also add a copy to [[14.11]] so it’s with the warranty. Or you add a copy of the title deed for your office premises to [[13.44]], but the original lives in [[12.11]]. This is okay. It’s part of being able to see the whole picture.\n\n\\*By ‘static’ we mean things that were sent to you that can’t be changed (e.g. a PDF). As compared to internal files that you work on (e.g. a spreadsheet). You should never have multiple copies of the latter. You’ll end up working on the wrong version and being very sad when you realise. This is not the Decimal way."
