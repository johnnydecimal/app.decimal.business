      "text": "It’s easy to lose track of all the logins we have these days. That’s why we recommend keeping up-to-date notes on who has access to what. Especially if you have account administrators with higher levels of control.\n\nThis is handy day to day (i.e. what’s the plan for when admins are on leave – who takes over?). It’s also useful when you’re onboarding and offboarding staff. If you’ve written it all down, you won’t forget to cancel access when someone leaves.\n\n## One scenario is your LinkedIn account\n\nTwo staff members are ‘super admins’, which means they can do anything. One of them leaves on bad terms and you forget about their access. One day they log in and type lots of rude words on the profile page. Oh dear. Obviously this can get worse with any accounts that involve money or other sensitive data.\n\nIn this case, we’d make a sub-ID, ‘14.41+ LinkedIn’, and write details about the account here. Who has access to it and so on.\n\nYou could keep lists of quick-links like this:\n\n- [Add admins on your page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a569144).\n- [Remove your page admin’s role](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1481276)."
