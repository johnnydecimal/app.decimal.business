These items _support_ the products they sell – fitness, cut grass, and hair cuts, respectively.\n\nA photographer’s screens, cameras, and lights are front office – they support the delivery of their product, the photographs.\n\nA plumber’s tools and logo-bearing work shirt are front office – they support the delivery of their product, the unblocked toilet.\n\nHowever, if the plumber replaces a broken part in a toilet with a spare from their van, then that would be classified under ‘product’. They are on-selling the spare part, so that gets tracked in [[20-29]]."
