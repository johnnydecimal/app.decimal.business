      "overview": "This is a place for bills, paperwork, and anything else related to the security and safety of the front office. This might be empty if your back office setup covers both areas.\n\nAs per [[12.22]], this would be a good place to put processes. For instance, your restaurant’s front office with flames and sharp knives will have very different safety procedures and equipment to the back office where you sit at a desk doing accounts.\n\nAnd there might be a completely different way to access your front office (a computerised alarm system and automatic doors) versus the back office (a padlocked roller door in a loading dock).\n\nThis is not for staff occupational health and safety, but there may be some overlap with training and other compliance obligations.",
      "exceptions": "This is not your business risk and emergency management plans, they’re in [[11.23]].",
      "alsoSee": "If anything here helps you meet compliance obligations (e.g. installing exit signs and a sprinkler system), store the paperwork here and note it in [[11.13]].\n\nEnsure anything relevant in [[11.51]] is aligned with information here."
