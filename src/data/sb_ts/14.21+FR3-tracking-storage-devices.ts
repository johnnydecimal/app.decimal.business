This is something to consider in [[14.40]].\n\nWe recommend recording their usual location. This might just be a note in your JDex. Are they in a drawer, cupboard, vehicle, locked safe? Are they used by a particular staff member and/or taken offsite?\n\nIt might be worth having regular audits or reviews so you know where your stuff is. You donâ€™t want someone carrying around your company's intellectual property on an insecure USB stick."
