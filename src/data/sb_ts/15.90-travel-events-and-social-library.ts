  "description": "A place to put information thatâ€™s related to this category, kinda interesting, mostly unimportant, and definitely doesnâ€™t fit elsewhere.\n\n## Examples\n\n## Overview\n\nCaution. This is a place for when there is no other place. Donâ€™t get lazy and dump stuff here that is important and/or has a home elsewhere in the system.\n\nThis might be information that you found interesting or might be useful someday. But right now, itâ€™s not strongly related to any other ID. And it would not make sense to clutter an existing ID or create a new one for it.\n\nItâ€™s a library so we want to keep it neat. Label any files with clear descriptions and use the year-month method in case the information is time sensitive.\n\n## Exceptions\n\n## Also see\n\n# Rationale\n\nWe wanted to be realistic and acknowledge that sometimes there is miscellanea that accumulates over time. It could be anything â€“ a document, photo, URL, email, note, or a physical item. But itâ€™s not the _work_ that you do. Itâ€™s things that youâ€™ve found online or in real life, or perhaps that youâ€™ve created.\n\nIt doesnâ€™t fit anywhere else. Itâ€™s just a thing you wanted to save. And you donâ€™t want it muddying other folders where work happens. Importantly, itâ€™s not that important. It has nothing to do with business operations. If it wasnâ€™t backed up it wouldnâ€™t matter. If you lose it, you could probably download it again.\n\n\n## Links\n\n# Description",
