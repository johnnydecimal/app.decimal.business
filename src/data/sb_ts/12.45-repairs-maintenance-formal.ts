But the soft serve machine’s maintenance goes in [[12.34]].\n\nAs per [[12.43]], reconcile receipts in your inbox as required and archive them neatly here.\n\nIf you have many vehicles, store their documents in subfolders labelled with the vehicle name and/or registration. And use one of the recommended date patterns to start file names so they sort neatly.",
      "exceptions": "Repairing and maintaining equipment that’s in/on the vehicle is part of [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].\n\nThis is not for daily running expenses, put those in [[12.43]].",
      "rationale": "We made a decision to include less frequent purchases up here, such as tyres and spare parts. \n\nThey’re still running expenses, but you only buy them sporadically. And they tend to be linked directly to a repair or discovered during routine maintenance. \n\nHere they won’t be lost among receipts for daily running expenses like fuel and other consumables. And they’ll be close to maintenance and service records, which may be relevant for warranties or future re-sale value. \n\nBut if you feel differently, do what works for you."
