It could be a building or land.\n\nYou might have more than one fixed location – that’s fine, just use subfolders labelled with the address to separate them. And remember to name files consistently and use the year-month-day method so everything sorts neatly.\n\nThis can also include the future, so store your lease applications or property searches here too.",
