Just keep them all here for however long you’re required to by law.\n\nBut for ‘important’ receipts for higher-value items and/or anything with a warranty, you might like to add a copy to where the thing lives in the system. For instance, you buy a new laptop. The receipt sits in the expenses inbox until you process it. You then permanently file it here and also add a copy to [[14.11]]."
