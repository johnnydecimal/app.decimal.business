      "examples": "If you run a beauty salon, your front office is:\n\n- your shopfront, customer reception area, and treatment rooms.\n\nIf you‚Äôre a personal trainer, your front office might be:\n\n- a gym where you rent space, or\n- a registered area in a park (and your equipment is part of front office operations).\n\nIf you‚Äôre a freelance writer, your front office might be:\n\n- non-existent because you only meet clients at their office, or\n- a co-working space that you meet clients in, or\n- the same as your back office, clients come to you for meetings (and the fancy coffee and snacks you offer are part of front office operations).",
      "overview": "By ‚Äòfront office‚Äô we mean the part of your business premises that is customer facing and supports the delivery of your product or service.\n\nBut it is _not_ the thing you sell. Some industries call this ‚Äòfront of house‚Äô if that makes it easier to think about.\n\nFor instance:\n\n- A baker‚Äôs sausage roll is their product, the branded napkins for customers are a front office supply (and they‚Äôre not what staff get in the back office).\n- A haircut is a hairdresser‚Äôs product, the coffee and biscuits for customers are front office supplies.\n- A clean dog is a dog groomer‚Äôs product, the hose used to wash it is a front office supply.\n\nIt might be an actual office, a retail store, the front of a cafe or bar, or a public space. It‚Äôs wherever you interact with your customers and the equipment or services you use during these interactions.\n\nAnd while many businesses might have a similar back office set-up, your front office will be tailored to you.",
      "exceptions": "If you do everything in your back office and never interact with customers, this section will be empty. That‚Äôs okay.\n\nParts of this system will be very quiet for many businesses and super busy for others.\n\nFor instance, Johnny.Decimal HQ operates solely in a rented back office, with two staff, and no vehicles. Most of our business administration is money-related, and even then, our accountant does the heavy lifting.\n\nWhen Lucy was a freelance writer, everything happened in her back office ‚Äì a desk with a laptop. Pretty simple.",
      "rationale": "As mentioned in [[12.20]], we decided to separate back office and front office because, depending on the business, these areas might have quite different equipment, suppliers, and daily operations.\n\nAnd different people might manage each area (you don‚Äôt want people trying to open the same spreadsheet at the same time).\n\nWhen we were thinking about this, we often referred to the TV show, The Bear. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, it‚Äôs about a restaurant in Chicago.\n\nThe back office is run by Natalie. She‚Äôs in a room with a desk and a computer, sorting out all their administrative chaos.\n\nThe front office is run by Richie. He‚Äôs in charge of the restaurant area where the customers are and the delivery of the product.\n\nThe ‚Äòproduct‚Äô is run by Carmy. He‚Äôs in charge of the kitchen where the food is made, i.e. the product that they sell.\n\nSome business are simpler than this, some might be more complicated. But hopefully this conveys the basic idea of ‚Äòstaff only‚Äô versus ‚Äòcustomer facing‚Äô areas."
