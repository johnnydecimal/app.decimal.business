      "overview": "What sort of workplace do you want to have? This is a place for figuring this out and writing it down.\n\nFor instance, official policies for how staff can expect to be treated and should behave. General processes around internal communications or managing a team. Staff-retention strategies to help everyone feel comfortable, get along, and enjoy their work.\n\nIf youâ€™re a sole trader, maybe you decide on some internal policies with yourself (why not!). Such as what your working hours are, how often you will check email or other channels, taking regular days off to avoid burn out, or making time for business admin each week. Anything that maintains morale and keeps you motivated.",
