      "overview": "This is for any kind of equipment and supplies that you use to run the back office.\n\nMost likely, this will be classic ‘office stuff’. However, if ‘back office’ means something very specific to your business, then include whatever is relevant for you.",
      "exceptions": "Furniture that is a permanent fixture built during a fit-out goes in [[12.14]].\n\nIf you lease any IT equipment like computers, printers, or photocopiers, put it here. If you buy it, put it in [[14.10]].",
      "rationale": "We made a decision to separate lease-as-service IT equipment versus one-off purchases. A supplier is providing an ongoing service to you, so managing that becomes part of daily operations.\n\nBut if you buy computers, printers, or other IT gadgets outright, store the records and product manuals with your other technology in [[14.10]]."
