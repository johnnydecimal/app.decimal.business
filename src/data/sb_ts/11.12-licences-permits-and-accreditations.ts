Now you need the legal proof that you can provide a product or service.\n\nThis ‘proof’ will vary considerably depending on what you do. If you run a bar, you’ll need a liquor licence. If you’re a healthcare provider in private practice, you must have a degree, as well as any other required accreditations.\n\nThis is an important ID to keep up-to-date in your JDex and to set reminders for so nothing expires.",
