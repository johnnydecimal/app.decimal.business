Then you can search the app for the ID and a keyword.\n\n1Password will let you do this with tags, others might as well. But adding it to the title or another field should also work.\n\nFor example, searching for:\n\n- ‘12.25’ will show the logins in your back office related to food and beverage.\n- ‘12.25 coffee’ will go straight to your coffee subscription login.\n- ‘12.42’ will go straight to your vehicle insurance login, etc."
