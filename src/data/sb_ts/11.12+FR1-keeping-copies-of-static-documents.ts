You should never have multiple copies of things like that because someone will inevitably update the wrong version.\n\nHowever, licences, permits, and accreditations are static documents. Probably a PDF or a piece of paper. It’s okay to put copies of them where it’s helpful and makes sense to do so. They’re not going to change unless they are renewed."
