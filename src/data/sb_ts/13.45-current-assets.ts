Shorter term means for less than one accounting period (i.e. less than 1 year).\n\nDuring this time you expect to sell or consume these items. And/or they’re the type of thing that can be easily converted to cash if needed. These type of assets are classified as ‘tangible’ because you can physically touch them.\n\n### Saving files\n\nThis ID should contain copies of records saved elsewhere in the system. That’s okay because these are static records. We want a place where you and/or your accountant can go to see the proof of ownership and value of any current assets in one place.\n\nFor instance, a furniture maker’s stock (finished products to sell to customers) and inventory (raw materials used to make the products) are current assets. He manages these in [[20-29]]. He copies valuations and receipts here for his accountant. And he also has a master finance record in [[13.11]] that includes a summary of his current assets because that’s how he rolls."
