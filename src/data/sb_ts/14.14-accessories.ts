And if you decide to sell anything, manage that here too.\n\nThis is also a place to keep any troubleshooting notes that you’ve written and settings/configuration you’ve applied. This comes in handy when you need to replace your accessory or set up new accessories for staff.\n\nWe recommend naming subfolders by purchase date and model.",
      "exceptions": "This is not for accessories related to data storage – those go in [[14.21]].\n\nThis is not for accessories related to processing payments – those go in [[12.34]].\n\nIf you pay a third party to use an accessory and they control it (e.g. a fancy photocopier with a service contract), manage that in [[12.24]] or [[12.34]].",
      "alsoSee": "If you sell a high-value accessory, record the details in [[13.26]] after processing the income.\n\nIf you purchase a high-value accessory, record the details in [[13.44]] after processing the asset.\n\nIf you’re paying off an accessory, process the bills in [[13.30]] or [[13.50]].\n\nSee [[14.31]] for the overall service that an accessory contributes to (e.g. printing, scanning, photocopying)."
