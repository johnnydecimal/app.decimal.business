Who do you trust the most to log in to things, pay bills, and contact people on your behalf?\n\nIn our [Life Admin System](https://jdcm.al/14.11/), we discuss the concept of an emergency digital recovery kit. Which is basically just a list of instructions, stored in a secure location, that outlines your digital life for a trusted person in an emergency. In this case, it’s for your business.\n\nThis will obviously contain sensitive information, so don’t leave it lying around! There’s a good chance that your password manager can help you manage this kind of thing securely."
