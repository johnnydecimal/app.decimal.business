He’ll _probably_ store his (encrypted) list here. But there is some overlap with customer management. In times like this we ask ourselves “where would a new staff member look for this?”. We reckon they’d try here first.\n\nAnd remember, mailing lists contain personal data. So you need to be aware of applicable privacy and data protection laws (like the GDPR). Especially if you decide to switch platforms and need to export data, or if a subscriber requests a copy of their data from you."
