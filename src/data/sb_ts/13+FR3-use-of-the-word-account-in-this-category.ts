      "text": "## An account could be many things\n\nFor simplicity, when we say account we’re referring to any account or service that manages money in some way. This includes traditional cash, credit card, loan, or investment accounts. But also online platforms, apps, and any other modern service. For instance, PayPal, Stripe, ‘buy now, pay later’ providers, money-transfer services, or even digital currency exchanges and wallets.\n\n## Different accounts for different tasks\n\nWhile many businesses will have one cash account to handle all incomings and outgoings (i.e. a standard business bank account), we wanted to leave room for those who do things differently. For instance, you might have completely (or mostly) separate accounts for income and expenses. If so, you may prefer to keep them in either [[13.22]] or [[13.32]].\n\nHere’s some scenarios.\n\n**A cooking school has online courses on a learning platform:**\n\n- Customer transactions are handled by Stripe.\n- This account is one-way only. It collects and holds income, and transfers it to a standard business bank account each month.\n- The owners keep account paperwork from Stripe in [[13.22]].\n- And their standard business bank account records are in [[13.42]].\n\n**A veterinary surgery accepts payments via Afterpay:**\n\n- The Afterpay retail account is linked to a standard business bank account.\n- The owners keep account paperwork from Afterpay in [[13.22]].\n- And their standard business bank account records are in [[13.42]].\n\n**A chicken rescue charity keeps separate bank accounts for income and expenses:**\n\n- All donations are collected in one bank account, which is managed in [[13.22]].\n- All expenses are paid from a different bank account, which is managed in [[13.32]].\n- They also have a standard business bank account for other miscellanea, which is managed in [[13.42]].\n\nWho knows what other variations occur in real life. An eBay store with an income-only PayPal account. Or a business that prefers to pay for all their expenses with Bitcoin. If this sounds like you, then [[13.22]] and [[13.32]] might be useful.\n\nOtherwise, just manage your standard business bank account in [[13.42]]."
