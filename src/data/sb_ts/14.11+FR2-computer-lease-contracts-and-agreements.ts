It felt logical that computers should stay down in technology world.\n\nConversely, in [[14.12]] we recommend that overarching mobile phone contracts and agreements should live up in operations. Because that feels like something that should be alongside other utilities. In this case, the device itself is separate to the contract, so it’s managed down here in technology. If you feel strongly either way, let’s discuss it."
