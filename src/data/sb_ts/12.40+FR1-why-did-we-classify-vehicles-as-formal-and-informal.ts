      "text": "Many businesses manage all kinds of vehicles that are part of their daily operations. But the more we thought about it, we weren’t sure that a one-size-fits-all approach was the right way. So in this section we’ve suggested that vehicles be classified into two buckets – ‘formal’ and ‘informal’.\n\n_Formal_ vehicles include anything that requires official registrations and inspections, whether it’s motorised or not. If it travels on a public road and requires insurance, or does anything serious like carrying passengers or dangerous goods, then manage it in:\n\n- [[12.41]],\n- [[12.42]],\n- [[12.43]],\n- [[12.44]], and\n- [[12.45]].\n\n_Informal_ vehicles do not fit the above description. Manage those, as well as any public or shared transportation that your business uses, in [[12.46]].\n\nAs always, if you can’t decide what goes where, don’t stress. Just make a decision and note what you did in your JDex. And if you want to discuss our classification, head over to the [[community]]."
