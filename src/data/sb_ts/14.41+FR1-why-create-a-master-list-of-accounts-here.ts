Whether they’re internal or external, or related to technology, daily operations, or anything else.\n\nBy _internal_ we mean things related to an internal service in your workplace, like logging in to your laptop or file servers. And by _external_ we mean any form of third-party website, software, or app.\n\nAnd an account doesn’t have to be related to technology to be in this list. A weekly fruit box delivery to the back office isn’t ‘technology’ just because it’s ordered online.\n\nKeep any details about the everyday _management_ of the fruit box delivery in [[12.25]]. The fact that you have a login is noted here with all your other accounts."
