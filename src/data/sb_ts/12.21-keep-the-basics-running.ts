And if you have more than one back office, use per-site subfolders and keep things consistent.\n\nThese utilities and services might be specific to the back office, or they might also support the front office. It doesn’t matter if there’s some overlap, as long as you know where things are. \n\nA cafe might have one electricity connection that supplies all areas. Or a co-working space might have one wifi connection for back office staff and front office tenants. \n\nIn both cases, they prefer to store their bills and other paperwork in back office. (Hint: just write yourself a note in your JDex if this applies to you.)\n\nThis would also be a good place to put troubleshooting tips related to a service. \n\nFor instance, under ‘water’ save instructions for how to turn the water main off. Under ‘electricity’ save a diagram of the fuse box layout and what to do in a blackout or power surge. Under ‘internet’ save instructions for how to reset the wifi router."
