 * The ops manual view component. So we're at /AC.03+OPS00
 *
 * Shows a single ID, with all of its detail. Shows breadcrumbs
 * to its category and area.
 *
 * So we need:
 * √ To be passed the number of the id to render. This is the slug.
 * √ The whole system to reference. Just import it directly.
 * √ The title of the ID for the main header.
 * √ All of its other details for the main content.
 *   √ Wiki-linking the descriptive text.
 * - Its parent category (number & title), and
 * - Its parent category's parent area (number & title).
 * - Linking the ID header to the ID URL.
 * - Denoting with styles and a ■ whether it's a header.
