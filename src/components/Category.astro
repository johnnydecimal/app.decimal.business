/**
 * The category list view component. So we've navigated to
 * /jdex/11.
 *
 * Shows the category and all of its IDs, grouped by header.
 *
 * ```
 * üïö 11 Eleven                                          [emoji, big?]
 *      The description of category eleven.
 *
 * ## 11.10 Official documents üóÇ Ô∏è
 *          Description
 *    11.11 Structure & registrations
 *          Description
 *    11.12 ...
 *
 * ## 11.20 Planning, contingencies, & insurance üß≠
 *          Description
 *    11.21 ...
 * ```
 *
 * So we need:
 * - To be passed the number of the category to render. This is the slug.
 * - To check that the category exists, and 404 if not.
 * - The whole system to reference. Just import it directly.
 * - The title of the category for the main header.
 * - The emoji of the category.
 * - An array of the IDs that this category contains. Each one of those
 *   needs to contain the ID, title, description, isHeader, emoji.
