/**
 * The category list view component.
 *
 * Shows all categories, grouped by area, with their one-line description.
 * Should probably also show the area description?
 *
 * ```
 * # 10-19 The teens
 *         From ten to nineteen. Even though eleven isn't a teen.
 *      11 Eleven
 *         Eleven as in 'legs eleven'.
 *      12 Twelve
 *         Twelfth of August is grouse hunting day.
 * # 20-29 The twenties
 *         Almost half way through them by now!
 *      21 Twenty one
 *         You got given a key or some other pointless trinket.
 * ```
 *
 * Should be a simple render job. I doubt any of the descriptions contain
 * a wiki-link? But if they do that should be an easy retro-fit later.
