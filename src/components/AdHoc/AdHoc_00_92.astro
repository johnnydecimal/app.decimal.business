People boast of their closed 'private community' as if restricting access is a good thing. We disagree.

Our community is open. We believe that we can become more efficient if we work together. You're welcome to join us and ask for help even if you're not a member.
`;

const language = `
One problem with existing communities is that they lack a shared language. This is the same problem you face with your file system: there are any number of ways to refer to the same concept. Confusion results from the ambiguity.

Our system defines a language. When we're talking about payroll, that's _always_ [13.34 Payroll](/13.34).<sup>1</sup> So now you can ask for help in a really specific place.

We have two communities, [Discord](http://discord.gg/KYWzAJhmPv) and [the forum](https://forum.johnnydecimal.com/c/small-business/18). Both will have dedicated small business sections whose structure mirrors the system.

So you won't find yourself asking for payroll help in a channel full of people talking about their tax returns. We'll keep everything in the right channel.  **Jump in, get targeted help, and get back to work**.

> 1. If you searched for \`payroll\` on the previous page, do you now find yourself remembering the number? :-) 
`;

const feedback = `
A problem with communities is that knowledge can be really hard to find. If you didn't see it scroll past the first time, you're probably _never_ going to see it.

This is why I built this system as a website. Lucy and I will be constantly monitoring our communities, and feeding information that should be persistent back in to the system.

If it's useful, it'll become permanent. You shouldn't have to worry about searching a forum for information. We'll do that for you.

A [Platinum](https://store.johnnydecimal.com/cart/43063017111688:1) membership is for life and is only [US$300](https://store.johnnydecimal.com/cart/43063017111688:1) while we are in pre-launch. [Gold is US$150](https://store.johnnydecimal.com/cart/43069054648456:1) for one year.

Prices will increase when the system is launched.
