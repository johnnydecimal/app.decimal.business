const why = `
Let's face it: **you don't know where most of your important files are**.

You're busy running a business and the last thing you have time for is organising your file system. So it's chaos.

This costs you time, money, and mental energy. It takes you away from _running your business_.

We're experts at this, so we made it our job to solve this inefficiency. Leave this to us.
`;

const how = `
The [Johnny.Decimal system](https://johnnydecimal.com) sets out a methodical way to structure your files. Thousands of people have used it to organise their lives for over a decade. It's simple, and it works.

But you don't have time to figure out how to apply this to your business. And why reinvent the wheel? We've done it for you.

The small business system is a pre-built framework. It gives you a place for everything. **All you have to do is move in**.
`;

const what = `
This site -- the one you're reading -- _is_ the system. So you can try-before-you-buy. Just click around. You'll find about 20% of the content is unlocked.

When you sign up, you get full access. There are 235 hand-crafted IDs across 15 categories, in 4 areas. It's a complete business operations manual: there are 35,000+ words of content, and we're not finished.

Search is in demo mode. Try it out: think of the last thing you couldn't find, and search for it.<sup>1</sup>

_Your_ files live on _your_ computer. **We never have access to your files**. You download a complete folder structure that mirrors this site, as well as text files that you can use to set up your local [index](https://jdcm.al/11.05/).

There are many other benefits, which we'll explore on the coming pages.

> 1. We're still building the system; search is incomplete.
`;

const cost = `
Platinum membership is for life. It gets you access to **everything we ever create, for all of time, for a [one-off payment of US$300](https://store.johnnydecimal.com/cart/43063017111688:1)**.<sup>1</sup>

Gold membership is for one year.<sup>2</sup> You have access to everything we do for as long as you're a member. It costs [US$150 a year](https://store.johnnydecimal.com/cart/43069054648456:1).<sup>3</sup>

These are pre-sale prices. They will increase when we launch the system.

This is what me and my partner Lucy do full-time: we quit our jobs to do this. Your membership supports two humans who hand-craft everything you see. There's no faceless corporation. No lazy AI-generated slop. No automated helpdesk. You email me, I answer.

Think of this like having us on your staff.

> 1. Prices include GST in Australia.
> 2. Renews one year after the full system is released, not one year after your initial payment.
> 3. You'll _never_ lose access to your system. If you choose not to renew, you'll just stop getting updates.
`;

const when = `
As you'll see when you're browsing the site, we're still building the system. We are targeting a first release of end-March 2025.
`;

const also = `
As this is a Johnny.Decimal membership, you get **everything else** that we produce.

That's the [workshop](https://jdcm.al/14.22/) ($90), [workbook](https://jdcm.al/14.21/), and [life admin system](https://jdcm.al/14.11/). Platinum also includes our 14-hour beginner Excel course, [Learn with Lucy](https://learnwithlucy.rocks).
