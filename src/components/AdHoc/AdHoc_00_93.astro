const numbers = `
There's a really simple system behind the numbers that makes it impossible to get lost.

All of your stuff -- your files, notes, emails -- lives inside an ID. The page you're reading is an ID: its number is \`00.93\`.

The number tells you where this thing is. This one's in category \`00\`. Where's category \`00\`? It's in area \`00-09\`. You can see this structure in the links above.

This structure is mirrored on your computer. Guess how you organise your files?

  <source
    media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)"
    srcset="/img/00.93A-Finder-light-792x294.png"
  />
  <source
    media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"
    srcset="/img/00.93A-Finder-dark-792x294.png"
  />
  <img
    alt="A screenshot of the macOS finder showing a simple hierarchy. Folder '10-19 Company admin' contains folder '13 Money earned, spent, saved, & owed', which in turn contains folder '13.34 Payroll'."
    id="finder"
    src="/img/00.93A-Finder-light-792x294.png"
    width="396"
    height="147"
  />

This makes it really hard to lose stuff.

You don't even have to create these folders yourself. You'll download the complete structure from this site.<sup>1</sup>

const outloud = `
These numbers give you a superpower: now you can tell anyone where anything is, instantly.

_'Hey Susan, where's our payroll stuff?'_  
**â€” Thirteen-thirty-four**.

Think how convenient this is when you're on a video call. No more trying to explain to someone which one of your 'finance' folders they have to try to find...
`;

const noMaths = `
In case it's not obvious: there's no maths here. You can put the slide rule away.

The numbers are just a convenient reference. So it doesn't matter if you're '_not a numbers person_'. There's nothing to be afraid of.
