This system has been designed to accommodate everything that a business _might possibly need_.

But the converse is not true: you don't have to use _everything in the system_. We have an entire category dedicated to [shipping & fulfilment](/35) but if you're a hairdresser, that's not something you ever do. And that's okay.

This is intended to encourage you to think about your own business. You probably _shouldn't_ just copy one of these examples. If you need help, we're always available. Just ask. Maybe we can tell your story?

const quadrant = `
We've divided all businesses up in to four quadrants.

On one extreme you **produce** a thing, and on the other you **deliver** a service. And the thing you produce or deliver might be **tangible** or **intangible**.

We can plot this on a quadrant chart.
