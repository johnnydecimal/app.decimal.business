      "overview": "I go to great lengths to protect my own privacy. I use an [independent search engine](https://kagi.com), an [independent, Swiss-based email service](https://migadu.com), a [network-level DNS filter](https://nextdns.io), a [local ad blocker](https://1blocker.com), and the [most privacy-preserving VPN on the planet](https://mullvad.net). I pay money for all of these services (yes, I pay for my search engine).\n\nI tell you this so that you believe me when I say that **I care about your privacy as much as you do**. These aren't just some words that I'm saying to placate you. I mean it.\n\nThe simplest way for me to care about your privacy is to collect as little of your personal data as possible. Here's how.\n\n#### Making a purchase\n\nWhen you make a purchase, you enter your email address, name, street address, and credit card details on my Shopify store.\n\nShopify needs these details to validate your card purchase and prevent fraud.\n\nI can see your email address, name, and street address. But I'll never use them without your permission.\n\nFor example, I don't sign you up to my mailing list unless you check that box. Perhaps making me the only online store in the world where that button _actually does something_. 😡\n\nI can only see the last 4 digits of your credit card number.\n\n#### Your details on this site\n\nAs of the time of writing, I can see the values that you store in your [user settings](/01). For example, the name of your Obsidian vault, if you specify one.\n\nThey're in a dashboard at [Clerk](https://clerk.com), the service I use for authentication. I'd have to go looking for them to see them. I won't, unless you specifically ask for support that requires me to do so.\n\nI'd really like to encrypt these settings one day, but doing so isn't trivial. Given the nature of the data, it's not high on my list.\n\n#### Web analytics\n\nPeople conflate 'analytics' with 'trackers', which is a shame. But the industry dug that hole for themselves, so here we are.\n\n'Analytics' tells me, at a very high level, how many people visit this site, and which pages they view. This helps me spot broad patterns.\n\nI use the open source [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com) for this. It doesn't track _you_ in any way. So it isn't recording that _you_ visited this page or that page. It just records that _somebody_ did.\n\nMany ad blockers will block these requests out of the box. If you'd like to do it explicitly, block `jdcmal.goatcounter.com`.\n\n(By the way, this has been possible since the first web server. _Every_ server will show you a log of the requests it's served, and that's essentially all that this is.)\n\n#### Cookies\n\n[Clerk](https://clerk.com), the service I use for authentication, uses cookies to track your user session, i.e. if you are logged in or not.\n\n#### Contact me\n\nIf you have [any concerns at all](mailto:hello@johnnydecimal.com).\n\nI've been on the internet since 1994. I remember it when it wasn't full of sleaze and junk. I'm doing my best to be a good citizen."

They manufacture their own range of body-care products, and sell them in-store and online.\n\nJeff is at the very top-left of our quadrant chart. He **produces** a **physical thing**.\n\nThis is how he might use categories `20` through `39`.\n\n## 21 Products & services\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nJeff creates his own line of products. At `21` he stores the recipes and any other information related to the creams and lotions that he manufactures.\n\n## 22 Suppliers & vendors\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nJeff can't make his product without supplies: the raw ingredients that he uses to manufacture it. He keeps records of his suppliers at `21`.\n\n## 23 Equipment & machines\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nJeff really does _make_ his own stuff. He's not just buying it in.\n\nSo he has all sorts of machines that help him do that, from wax melters to lotion pourers to paper folders to make the finished product look nice.\n\n## 24 Processes & procedures\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nThis is where Jeff tracks the _actual making of the thing_. While the recipe for the lotion is at `21`, here he tracks the processes used to make it, and the associated processes such as good manufacturing practice (GMP) and quality control (QC).\n\n## 25 Inventory & stock\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nEverything that Jeff buys from a `22 Supplier` is **inventory**, and after he's used it to manufacture a thing, it it becomes **stock** (or **finished goods**).\n\n## 31 Marketing, PR, & communications\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nHow would anyone know Jeff existed unless he told them? From online campaigns to the A-frame on the pavement outside his store, `31` is the place for all marketing efforts.\n\n## 32 Sales channels\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nWithout a mechanism to sell his stuff, how could you buy it? Jeff has two primary channels: his physical store, and his Shopify store. He tracks them here.\n\n## 33 Customers & clients\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nWhile Jeff has many customers, as a retail operation he doesn't spend a lot of time tracking them.\n\nHis customer data primarily exists in QuickBooks and Shopify. If he needs to extract it to work on it, or if he creates a backup, that data lives here.\n\n- Note: when we say 'heavily used', we don't mean that he's in his file system in folder `33`. We just mean that `customers` are an integral part of Jeff's business.\n\n## 34 Orders & jobs\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nSimilarly, Jeff's orders are either made in-store, in which case they're immediately fulfilled, or on Shopify, which tracks the status of an order. Either way, this is the place for anything to do with those orders.\n\n- Note: ibid.\n\n## 35 Shipping & fulfilment\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nLess relevant for the in-store transactions -- the customer just takes those away with them -- but the Shopify orders need to be sent out to customers. Jeff will have a process that prints labels and notifies the customer that their shipment is on the way. That all lives here."

      "text": "For the sake of purity, let's say Gary the gardener just comes and cuts your grass. He's not bringing new bushes to your place so he can improve the landscaping. He's just starting out and delivers a really simple service.\n\nGary is at the far top-right corner of our quadrant chart. This is how he might use categories `20` through `39`.\n\n## 21 Products & services\n\n> 🟠 Lightly used.\n\nHis business is simple: he'll do anything for $30/hour as long as it's mowing the grass. That's his product.\n\n## 22 Suppliers & vendors\n\n> 🟠 Lightly used.\n\nGary does need to buy supplies: bags to take away the cut grass, a new mower every now and then. But it's likely he just goes to the local hardware store for this kind of thing. He probably doesn't have a deep relationship with his lawnmower supplier.\n\n## 23 Equipment & machines\n\n> 🟠 Lightly used.\n\nAs above, Gary does have equipment & machines, and should keep the purchase and warranty details for each of these machines here. But if he's just mowing the grass, this isn't going to be too busy.\n\n## 24 Processes & procedures\n\n> 🟠 Lightly used.\n\nGary won't have many documented procedures. Anyone can turn up and mow a lawn.\n\nBut take note: _every business should document their processes_. That's why we haven't marked this one as 🔴 not used.\n\n## 25 Inventory & stock\n\n> 🔴 Not used.\n\nThis is why we made it clear that Gary just cuts the grass vs. bringing over plants and shrubbery. Gary holds no inventory or stock. People whose product is pure service delivery often don't.\n\n## 31 Marketing, PR, & communications\n\n> 🟠 Lightly used.\n\nYou know of Gary because he put that leaflet in your letter-box last week. Pretty simple stuff, but nevertheless: marketing.\n\n## 32 Sales channels\n\n> 🟠 Lightly used.\n\nGary takes cash-in-hand. (Don't tell the tax office.) So he doesn't really have much by way of 'sales channels'.\n\nIf we think about a business that delivers a tangible service, it makes sense that it's a local, in-person kind of business. It's hard to deliver a tangible service remotely.\n\nSo it might be the case that you don't have that many sales channels. But who knows? Let us know if you find an exception.\n\n## 33 Customers & clients\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nWe doubt he's keeping meticulous records, but if he did, this is where they would be. That's why we've marked this as green: everyone has customers.\n\nAt the very least we hope Gary has a spreadsheet with his customers name, address, and phone number. Then if business is a little slow he can try ringing around.\n\n## 34 Orders & jobs\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nSimilarly, it'd be smart at tax-time if Gary had a nice list of all of his completed jobs and how much each one was worth. Better than trying to back-calculate from his bank statement.\n\n## 35 Shipping & fulfilment\n\n> 🔴 Not used.\n\nThere's nothing here for Gary. Someone asks him to come over, he turns up, and that's the job complete. 'Fulfilment' for us means processing and shipping an order; unlikely if your business is pure service delivery.\n\n#### Jane made it big\n\nJane started like Gary, then she worked hard and has built a successful business. She employs six people who she sends to her customer's site. They have ride-on mowers and can provide full landscaping services, which she quotes as individual jobs. She produces 3D renderings as part of this quoting process.\n\nJane is still in the top-right quadrant with Gary, but she's moved towards its centre.\n\nIn `21 Products & services` Jane has a bit more going on. She might have a more comprehensive list of services. Perhaps she builds each quote from this list, pulling together some hours of basic gardening at one cost, landscaping at another, and plant supply at wholesale cost plus a markup.\n\nSimilarly at `22 Suppliers & vendors`, she might have a more formal relationship with her rural supplies store. You can't buy the equipment she uses at your local hardware shop. This equipment is recorded at `23 Equipment & machines`.\n\nAt `24 Processes & procedures` Jane should have processes that document how and how often to clean and check the equipment. A ride-on mower is a serious bit of kit. Having this stuff written down means that she can give it to the apprentice on their first day rather than spending hours explaining stuff.\n\nFor many service-orientated businesses, their processes _are_ the business. Jane can't cash out of her business if all of its workings are in her head. But write them down, and she's done the smart thing: she's made herself redundant.\n\nJane might offer a full landscaping service. She might keep some common plants in stock because it's cheaper to buy them (or grow them?) in bulk. She'd track them at `25 Inventory & stock`. But unless she starts to run a garden centre, this probably won't be too busy.\n\nAs a result, all of these categories have moved from 🟠 lightly used and are probably 🟢 heavily used by Jane's business."

      "text": "My account is ... my accountant! We all know what they do.\n\nThey've been my accountant for 15 years and I've been to their office twice. There's essentially no physical component to our relationship. And they're not making a _product_ that I buy. They're delivering a _service_ that I _consume_.\n\nThey live at the bottom-right of the quadrant chart. This is how they might use the categories from 20-39.\n\n#### 21 Products & services\n\n> 🟠 Lightly used.\n\nMy accountant's service is the fact that they do my bookkeeping and quarterly/annual tax returns. That's something that they've defined, and that they present to me as a service with a specific hourly rate.\n\nThey might have other services. For example, company formation is something quite specific. This is where they track those services. But it won't be as heavily used as Jeff's `21`. After all, everyone just kinda understands what an accountant does. If you were qualified you could just start _being an accountant_ without defining a product; conversely, Jeff can't just _sell a product_ without having first designed and manufactured that product.\n\n#### 22 Suppliers & vendors\n\n> 🟠 Lightly used.\n\nMy accountant would track suppliers of specialist accounting services and software here.\n\nBut I know they mostly use Xero and Excel so this isn't going to be a busy place.\n\nEverything that keeps their office running is tracked up in `10-19`.\n\n## 23 Equipment & machines\n\n> 🔴 Not used.\n\nTheir tools are just Windows PCs. They're not specialised. They don't require any sort of maintenance or instruction above what we'd be storing in `14 Technology`.\n\nMy accountant wouldn't use this category at all.\n\n## 24 Processes & procedures\n\n> 🔴 Not used.\n\nSimilarly, they don't _make a thing_. There's nothing to manufacture. They wouldn't use this category.\n\n## 25 Inventory & stock\n\n> 🔴 Not used.\n\n…and if you don't make a thing, you can hardly track stock levels. Unused.\n\n## 31 Marketing, PR, & communications\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nAlthough I think they have a pretty stable customer base, but for the sake of argument: every business needs to do some sort of marketing. Whatever they do, it goes here.\n\nFor example, they send me a quarterly newsletter. That's customer communications and it lives here.\n\n## 32 Sales channels\n\n> 🟠 Lightly used.\n\nEveryone needs a way to sell a thing. My accountant uses an online service that sends me a quote at the start of the tax year. I pay the same amount each month so there are no surprises at the end of the year.\n\nThat system is a **channel** for my accountant. It's how I give them my custom. But they probably set it up years ago and don't give it much thought.\n\n## 33 Customers & clients\n\n> 🟢🟢 Overloaded!\n\nI imagine my accounant has a large (electronic) file with all of my details. Records of previous returns. Billing history. Probably secret notes that they keep about what a bad customer I am.\n\nIn fact, this is probably where they do the majority of their actual work. Because if they're not working _on a customer's file_, what are they doing? So I imagine this category would be **overloaded**: that is, they'd need to design some sort of **expanded category** scheme to accommodate.\n\n## 34 Orders & jobs\n\n> 🟠 Lightly used.\n\nSee `32`, above. I think my accountant's incoming orders are mostly pre-configured monthly amounts. Sure, they'll reconcile them against something.\n\nBut I suspect they don't spend much time thinking about who has 'ordered' some new service.\n\n## 35 Shipping & fulfilment\n\n> 🔴 Not used.\n\nSimilarly, they aren't tracking the 'fulfilment' of my quarterly tax returns. That's just part of the job. There's nothing for them here.\n\n- Note: they do send me stuff, very occasionally. But that's handled at `12.26 Keep us posted`."

They won't come to your place and show you how it works. Once they've delivered your app, that's it. Job done. That's why we're saying that there's no _delivery of service_ here: what you get is a program. They produce _a thing_.\n\nThey are at the bottom-left of the quadrant chart.\n\n## 21 Products & services\n\n> 🟠 Lightly used.\n\nIf we've read these stories in order, we might start to notice some patterns. It seems that most of us don't have _that_ many products & services to define.\n\nAnd that makes sense in the context of this system: it's the _small business system_. Not the _giant corporation system_. If you're small it's unlikely that you have time to generate a long list of offerings.\n\nJeff's business is different because he's actually manufacturing the things he sells. We guess he does a big run of, say, face cream. Then that has a shelf-life of a few years. And he reconfigures his machines to make something else. So his list of products is the largest we've seen.\n\nXe has one service: writing apps. They charge by the week, based on their estimate, which is based on the detailed job spec they received. Not much to record here.\n\n## 22 Suppliers & vendors\n\n> 🔴 Not used.\n\nAgain, a pattern seems to emerge. If you sell something intangible, you _probably_ don't have that many suppliers. But again, there'll be exceptions. These stories are meant to encourage you to think about this for your own business.\n\nXe has no suppliers. They use open-source or off-the-shelf software that they track at [[14.32]].\n\n## 23 Equipment & machines\n\n> 🔴 Not used.\n\nSimilarly, Xe uses the laptop that they bought at the local Apple store. They track this at [[14.11]]. There's nothing specialised about it; it's the same machine they use to do their accounts.\n\n## 24 Processes & procedures\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nXe's in to computers, so they've automated much of their workflow.\n\nYou don't email Xe. That's so 2019. When you want to engage them, you fill in an online form. This triggers a workflow that's documented at [[14.31]], but then Xe has a documented process that they use to analyse the job requirements and generate a quote.\n\nIf they didn't write this down, they might forget something and under-quote. Think of it like a pilot's checklist. This is why Xe is so good at their job.\n\n## 25 Inventory & stock\n\n> 🔴 Not used.\n\nAnother pattern: businesses dealing in intangibles can't really hold stock. Xe has nothing here.\n\nThis is like Johnny.Decimal. My Shopify store has a button that I can tick to track the stock levels of a product. But I sell PDFs or logins to this site: I can't run out of those, so there's nothing for me to track.\n\n## 31 Marketing, PR, & communications\n\n> 🔴 Not used.\n\nXe is so good, they have customers banging at the door. Not _everyone_ has to do marketing.\n\nWhen I was a consultant, I never did marketing. I got jobs because Australia's IT job market is small, and I'd worked in it for two decades. (My LinkedIn account doesn't count, and we track that at [[14.53]].)\n\n## 32 Sales channels\n\n> 🔴 Not used.\n\nWe're using Xe to show that you don't _have to_ track stuff here.\n\nXe has one way to get paid: direct bank deposit, before the job starts. (We told you they were good.)\n\nWhile this is _technically_ a sales channel, there's nothing to say here that we haven't already said at [[13.22]].\n\n## 33 Customers & clients & 34 Orders & jobs\n\n> 🟢 Heavily used.\n\nThere are two scenarios here, and they affect `33` and `34`. So let's talk about them together.\n\nIn the first scenario, Xe typically does one job per customer. The jobs are large and they completely satisfy that customer's needs. They don't need to ever come back.\n\nIn this situation, they probably prefer to manage most of this interaction in `33 Customers & clients`. Why bother going down to the level of a job -- jobs being assigned to customers -- when every customer only has one job?\n\nThe converse is that Xe has fewer clients, and they all come back for repeat business. In this situation, `34 Orders & jobs` is probably how they think about their work. Because if one customer has a bunch of jobs, you can't track them all directly under the customer. The job becomes the more important thing.\n\nThis is a typical pattern for freelancers. We can't tell you exactly how to work here: something will just feel right for you. Go with that, because it's the best way to be sure that you'll know where to find your stuff.\n\n## 35 Shipping & fulfilment\n\n> 🔴 Not used.\n\nAs with my accountant, there's no shipping to be done when the product is intangible."

It’s primarily business administration and they don’t ship physical products to customers. They do things like:\n\n- post signed paperwork to their accountant and lawyer,\n- courier brochure artwork proofs to their printer,\n- and send the odd parcel.\n\nConversely, a handmade candle business manages things like sending a letter to their accountant here. And _all_ of their candle shipping in [[20-29]]. They do things like:\n\n- buy pre-paid parcel satchels and packing materials in bulk,\n- and print address labels and other collateral material that goes in the parcels.\n\nAnd a handmade furniture business manages things like sending a letter to their lawyer here.

An eBay store with an income-only PayPal account. Or a business that prefers to pay for all their expenses with Bitcoin.

For instance, tap and go card readers or card terminals.

People like Johnny will tell us that this is a copy, not a backup, and we should not rely on it.\n\nYou might _think_ that you have a backup because you store your data in the cloud. But if you mess up a file and don’t realise for a week, that isn’t going to help. You can’t ‘roll back’ to a version of that file from a week ago like you can with a backup. Sure, some cloud services offer restoring features, but they are _not_ backups.\n\nA backup service is dedicated software that:\n\n- automatically keeps historical versions of your data,\n- at a schedule you define,\n- that is easy to recover.\n\nThe magic of a backup means that you can step back in time and recover whatever version of a file you need. And you don’t have to think about it – it’s happening constantly in the background.\n\nWhereas a copy ‘saved as’ to a hard drive is singular, it happened at a particular time point. This might not be so useful when your computer crashes before you hit save. It also relies on you _remembering_ to do it.\n\nWhether you conduct all, or most, of your business in the digital world, organising a trustworthy backup service is worth every penny."

For example, you type things in the web interface of an ADSL modem/router to create a wifi network.

For example, how to connect a laptop, phone, or printer to the wifi. Now we're ‘consuming the configuration’, if you like.\n\nHere’s a scenario for our office wifi:\n\n1. Our ISP has configuration – the notes go in [[14.32]].\n\n2. Our ADSL modem has configuration – the notes go in [[14.13]].\n\n3. Our wifi router has configuration. Ditto.\n\n4.

It’s also useful when you’re onboarding and offboarding staff. If you’ve written it all down, you won’t forget to cancel access when someone leaves.\n\n## One scenario is your LinkedIn account\n\nTwo staff members are ‘super admins’, which means they can do anything. One of them leaves on bad terms and you forget about their access. One day they log in and type lots of rude words on the profile page. Oh dear. Obviously this can get worse with any accounts that involve money or other sensitive data.\n\nIn this case, we’d make a sub-ID, ‘14.41+ LinkedIn’, and write details about the account here. Who has access to it and so on.\n\nYou could keep lists of quick-links like this:\n\n- [Add admins on your page](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a569144).\n- [Remove your page admin’s role](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a1481276)."

As a sole trader, Lucy didn’t know this either. Until Johnny came along, tapped a few keys, and did some DNS magic.\n\n## Domain name service\n\nSo that’s what DNS means: domain name service.
