This includes traditional cash, credit card, loan, or investment accounts. But also online platforms, apps, and any other modern service. For instance, PayPal, Stripe, ‘buy now, pay later’ providers, money-transfer services, or even digital currency exchanges and wallets.\n\n## Different accounts for different tasks\n\nWhile many businesses will have one cash account to handle all incomings and outgoings (i.e. a standard business bank account), we wanted to leave room for those who do things differently. For instance, you might have completely (or mostly) separate accounts for income and expenses. If so, you may prefer to keep them in either [[13.22]] or [[13.32]].\n\nHere’s some scenarios.\n\n**A cooking school has online courses on a learning platform:**\n\n- Customer transactions are handled by Stripe.\n- This account is one-way only. It collects and holds income, and transfers it to a standard business bank account each month.\n- The owners keep account paperwork from Stripe in [[13.22]].\n- And their standard business bank account records are in [[13.42]].\n\n**A veterinary surgery accepts payments via Afterpay:**\n\n- The Afterpay retail account is linked to a standard business bank account.\n- The owners keep account paperwork from Afterpay in [[13.22]].\n- And their standard business bank account records are in [[13.42]].\n\n**A chicken rescue charity keeps separate bank accounts for income and expenses:**\n\n- All donations are collected in one bank account, which is managed in [[13.22]].\n- All expenses are paid from a different bank account, which is managed in [[13.32]].\n- They also have a standard business bank account for other miscellanea, which is managed in [[13.42]].\n\nWho knows what other variations occur in real life. An eBay store with an income-only PayPal account. Or a business that prefers to pay for all their expenses with Bitcoin. If this sounds like you, then [[13.22]] and [[13.32]] might be useful.\n\nOtherwise, just manage your standard business bank account in [[13.42]]."

Sure, some cloud services offer restoring features, but they are _not_ backups.\n\nA backup service is dedicated software that:\n\n- automatically keeps historical versions of your data,\n- at a schedule you define,\n- that is easy to recover.\n\nThe magic of a backup means that you can step back in time and recover whatever version of a file you need. And you don’t have to think about it – it’s happening constantly in the background.\n\nWhereas a copy ‘saved as’ to a hard drive is singular, it happened at a particular time point. This might not be so useful when your computer crashes before you hit save.

Find them and put them in a password manager.\n\nPassword managers make your digital life much more secure, and also less frustrating by speeding up the login process. They’re inexpensive. Just get one.\n\nThe main consideration is probably whether it’s just for you, or if you have staff that need to use it. And if so, should different staff members have different levels of access to what’s inside.\n\nIn this case, look for password managers that make it easy to compartmentalise and share information.

For example, only the person who does the banking and accounts should be able to see the banking and accounting software logins.\n\nJust search for ‘password managers for business’ and you’ll get a bunch of hits.

You can’t store this in the app, it has to live in your head. **Never ever write that password down.** We will disown you.\n\nWe also recommend having a _verbal_ password that you and your staff can use on the phone to verify your identities. We read an article about a scam where people impersonate business owners, hence the warning.\n\nIt goes like this. A business owner went overseas to a conference. They mentioned specific details in their out-of-office message. A scammer got the message, called the office, and pretended to be the boss. “Hey, Paris is great, quick favour, my card failed, can you transfer $$$ to this other account, thanks, gotta run!”. This is where you say, “sure, what’s the password?” and they hang up."

If your eyes are glazing over, stay with us.\n\n_A domain is separate to any services that you run on it._ Whether that’s a website, blog, forum, email, or a bunch of other stuff like remote logins, VPNs, or file servers. So once you’ve registered your domain, you can use it for all sorts.\n\n## A big one for business owners is email\n\nWe often see vans proudly displaying their website (e.g. carolscupcakes.com) and email (e.g. carolscupcakes@gmail.com) in big letters down the side.\n\nUnfortunately Carol doesn’t know that she can easily set up a personalised email (e.g. hello@carolscupcakes.com) using her domain and her existing gmail account. As a sole trader, Lucy didn’t know this either. Until Johnny came along, tapped a few keys, and did some DNS magic.\n\n## Domain name service\n\nSo that’s what DNS means: domain name service. All the services that can run on your domain. For example, the domain, johnnydecimal.com, is registered at Porkbun. And we use other services to provide the website, email, and blog. But Porkbun is where we _point our domain to those services_.\n\nIt’s like the most important address book. So when someone wants to visit our website at johnnydecimal.com, we’ve told Porkbun to send them to our web hosting service. When someone wants to send us an email to hello@johnnydecimal.com, we’ve told Porkbun to send them to our email service.\n\nIn the future, we could make an ops manual to help with this kind of thing.

And so much time is wasted clicking around trying to find them.\n\n“When did I last use the logo?” “Is this the hi-res version?” “Where’s the final PDF of the new menu design?”\n\nWe need to get out of the habit of having 50 copies of our important creative assets, with different names, in multiple locations. And into the habit of having a neat set of folders containing a master copy of everything. As well as a separate place to work on new projects that doesn’t clutter where we do our daily business admin.\n\nWe discuss this in more detail in the creative categories."

Or perhaps you want to share them with others. For example, when onboarding new staff you might provide a list of resources like:\n\n- industry newsletters to sign up for,\n- trusted websites for research and reading,\n- blogs and RSS feeds to follow; communities to join,\n- YouTube or social media accounts to follow,\n- or trade journals to review.\n\nNote that this is a ‘special-case’ ID that happens to be in the technology library.
