We recommend using the year-month method when saving this kind of paperwork so everything sorts neatly.

They‚Äôre paid automatically and you don‚Äôt need to plan a time to physically transfer money. Those types of liabilities tend to recur predictably, either monthly or quarterly. \n\nFor instance, you‚Äôve set up direct debits for your utility bills. They‚Äôre paid automatically on the due date. Now they‚Äôre just expense transactions on your bank statement that you process and file in [[13.30]].\n\nCompare this to other bills that arrive unpredictably that you must pay manually. During one month you receive invoices from a carpenter, a car mechanic, and a new supplier who serviced your front office coffee machine. \n\nThese are standalone bills for specific jobs. They all have different payment terms. As they arrive, put them in the liabilities inbox. Then set aside time later to pay them in order of urgency. The processed invoices are permanently filed here.
